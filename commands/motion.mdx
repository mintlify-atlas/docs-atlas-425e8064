## Overview

Vim provides powerful commands for moving the cursor through your text. Mastering these motions is essential for efficient editing.

## Basic Movement

### Character Motion

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `h` | Move left one character |
| `l` | Move right one character |
| `j` | Move down one line |
| `k` | Move up one line |
| Arrow keys | Same as `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` |

<Tip>
Experienced users prefer `hjkl` because they're always under your fingers. Think of `j` as an arrow pointing downwards.

## Tips

<Tip>
Combine motions with operators for powerful editing:
- `d$` - Delete to end of line
- `c3w` - Change next 3 words
- `y}` - Yank to end of paragraph
</Tip>

<Warning>
The count multiplies with the motion. For example, `2d3w` deletes 6 words (2 × 3).
