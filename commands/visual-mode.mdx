### Visual Mode Tricks

```vim
" Reselect last visual selection and indent
gv>

" Select and delete inside function
vi{d

" Swap visual selection
viwp

" Increment numbers in visual block
CTRL-V
jjjjg CTRL-A
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Comment Multiple Lines

```vim
" Select lines
Vjjj

" Insert comment characters
:s/^/# /
```

### Example 2: Column Editing

```vim
" Select column
CTRL-V
jjjj

" Insert at the beginning
I
text<Esc>
```

### Example 3: Align Assignments

```vim
" Before:
let foo = 1
let barbaz = 2
let x = 3

" 1. Select the column where '=' appears
CTRL-V
jj
f=

" 2. Align using a plugin or manual spacing
```

### Example 4: Extract Function Arguments

```vim

vi{"bd

" Paste from register 'a'
"ap

" Copy to system clipboard
viw"+y
```

## Combining Visual with Search

```vim
" Select to next search match
v/pattern<CR>

" Select to previous match
v?pattern<CR>

" Extend selection to next match
n
```

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Extract and Move Code

y

" 3. Paste below
p
```

### Workflow 3: Reindent Code Block

=

" Or manual indent
>>
```

### Workflow 4: Column Editing in Table

## Tips

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: Use `gv` to reselect your last visual selection. This is incredibly useful when you need to perform multiple operations on the same text.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Combine visual mode with text objects for efficient selection:
- `vip` - Select paragraph
- `vi{` - Select inside braces
- `va"` - Select including quotes
</Tip>

<Warning>
In block-wise visual mode, `$` extends each line to its end, creating a ragged right edge rather than a rectangular block.
</Warning>

<Info>
Visual mode operations can be repeated with `.` but the selection size is fixed. Use macros for more flexible repetition.
