## Tips

<Tip>
Master the combination of operators and motions:
- Operators: `d` (delete), `c` (change), `y` (yank)
- Motions: `w` (word), `$` (end of line), `}` (paragraph)
- Examples: `dw`, `c$`, `y}`
</Tip>

<Warning>
Be careful with `dd` and `D` - deleted text goes into registers and can be recovered with `p`, but the numbered registers rotate with each deletion.
</Warning>
