# Registers and Clipboard

Vim's register system is a powerful feature that goes far beyond simple copy and paste. Registers are storage locations for text, and Vim provides multiple types of registers for different purposes.

## What Are Registers?

Registers are like clipboards in Vim. When you delete, change, or yank text, it goes into a register. When you paste, the text comes from a register.

<Note>
Registers are completely separate from marks. Marks remember positions, registers store text.
</Note>

## The Ten Types of Registers

Vim has ten types of registers, each serving a specific purpose:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Unnamed">
    **Register:** `""`
    
    The default register. Contains text from the last delete, change, or yank operation.
    
    ```vim
    dd     " Delete line → goes to unnamed register
    p      " Paste from unnamed register
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Numbered">
    **Registers:** `"0` to `"9`
    
    - `"0` contains the last yanked text
    - `"1` to `"9` contain the last 9 deletions (most recent in `"1`)
    
    ```vim
    yy     " Yank line → goes to "0
    dd     " Delete line → goes to "1, previous "1 → "2
    "0p    " Paste last yank
    "1p    " Paste last delete
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Small delete">
    **Register:** `"-`
    
    Contains deletions less than one line (unless a register was specified).
    
    ```vim
    dw     " Delete word → goes to "- and ""
    "-p    " Paste deleted word
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Named">
    **Registers:** `"a` to `"z` or `"A` to `"Z`
    
    Explicitly specified by the user. Uppercase appends.
    
    ```vim
    "ayy   " Yank line to register a
    "Ayy   " Append line to register a
    "ap    " Paste from register a
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Read-only">
    **Registers:** `":`, `".`, `"%`
    
    - `":` - Last command-line command
    - `".` - Last inserted text
    - `"%` - Current file name
    
    ```vim
    "%p    " Paste current filename
    ".p    " Paste last inserted text
    ":p    " Paste last command
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Alternate buffer">
    **Register:** `"#`
    
    Contains the name of the alternate file.
    
    ```vim
    "#p    " Paste alternate filename
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Expression">
    **Register:** `"=`
    
    Evaluates expressions. Used for calculations and function results.
    
    ```vim
    " In Insert mode:
    <C-R>=2+2<CR>  " Inserts "4"
    
    " In Normal mode:
    "=system('date')<CR>p  " Paste command output
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Selection/Clipboard">
    **Registers:** `"*`, `"+`, `"~`
    
    - `"*` - System primary selection (middle-click paste)
    - `"+` - System clipboard (Ctrl+C/V)
    - `"~` - Drag-and-drop text
    
    ```vim
    "+yy   " Copy line to system clipboard
    "+p    " Paste from system clipboard
    "*p    " Paste X11 selection
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Black hole">
    **Register:** `"_`
    
    The black hole register. Text goes in but never comes out.
    
    ```vim
    "_dd   " Delete line without affecting registers
    "_x    " Delete character without saving
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Last search">
    **Register:** `"/`
    
    Contains the last search pattern.
    
    ```vim
    "/p    " Paste last search pattern
    
    " Set search pattern from register:
    let @/ = @a
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Viewing Register Contents

To see what's in all registers:

```vim
:registers     " Show all registers
:reg           " Short form
:display       " Alternative command
```

**Example output:**
```
Type Name Content
  c  ""   deleted text
  c  "0   yanked text  
  c  "1   first deletion
  c  "a   text in register a
  c  "+   clipboard content
```

To view specific registers:

```vim
:reg a b c     " Show registers a, b, and c
:reg "0        " Show unnamed and "0 registers
:reg +         " Show clipboard register
```

<Info>
Register types: `c` = characterwise, `l` = linewise, `b` = blockwise.
</Info>

## Using Registers

### Specifying Registers

Use `"{register}` before an operator, yank, or put command:

<CodeGroup>

```vim Yank to register
"ayy      " Yank line to register a
"byw      " Yank word to register b
"cy$      " Yank to end of line into register c
```

```vim Delete to register
"add      " Delete line into register a
"xdw      " Delete word into register x
"z3dd     " Delete 3 lines into register z
```

```vim Paste from register
"ap       " Paste from register a
"bP       " Paste from register b before cursor
"0p       " Paste last yank (from register 0)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Appending to Registers

Use uppercase register names to append instead of replace:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Yank first piece">
    ```vim
    "ayy     " Yank line to register a
    ```
    Register a contains: "first line"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Append more text">
    ```vim
    j"Ayy    " Move down and append line to register a
    ```
    Register a now contains: "first line" + "second line"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Paste combined text">
    ```vim
    "ap      " Paste both lines
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Appending only works with named registers (a-z). You cannot append to numbered or special registers.
</Warning>

## Register Types

Registers store text in three different ways:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Characterwise" icon="font">
    Text without line breaks.
    
    ```vim
    yw    " Yank word (characterwise)
    p     " Paste after cursor
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Linewise" icon="align-left">
    Complete lines.
    
    ```vim
    yy    " Yank line (linewise)
    p     " Paste below current line
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Blockwise" icon="grip-vertical">
    Rectangular blocks.
    
    ```vim
    <C-V>jjlly  " Yank visual block
    p           " Paste block
    ```
  </Card>
</Columns>

The register type affects how text is pasted:
- **Characterwise:** Pasted after (`p`) or before (`P`) the cursor
- **Linewise:** Pasted below (`p`) or above (`P`) the current line
- **Blockwise:** Pasted as a rectangle starting at the cursor

## The Unnamed Register

The unnamed register (`""`) is special:

<Info>
The unnamed register acts like a pointer to the last used register. When you use an uppercase register name to append, the unnamed register contains the same text as the named register.
</Info>

```vim
"ayy     " Yank to register a
yy       " Yank to unnamed register
p        " Paste from unnamed (most recent yank)
"ap      " Paste from register a (first yank)
```

**Exception:** Operations using the black hole register (`"_`) don't affect any registers:

```vim
"_dd     " Delete line without changing any register
p        " Still pastes previous contents
```

## Numbered Registers (0-9)

### Register 0: Last Yank

Register `"0` always contains the text from the most recent yank command:

```vim
yy       " Yank line → goes to "0 and ""
dd       " Delete line → goes to "1 and ""
p        " Paste deletion (from "")
"0p      " Paste the yank (from "0)
```

<Tip>
Use `"0p` to paste your last yank even after deleting something.
</Tip>

### Registers 1-9: Deletion History

Registers `"1` through `"9` form a deletion history queue:

- `"1` contains the most recent deletion (more than one line)
- Each new deletion shifts the previous contents: `"1` → `"2`, `"2` → `"3`, etc.
- `"9` is discarded when a new deletion enters `"1`

**Example:**
```vim
dd       " Delete line 1 → "1
dd       " Delete line 2 → "1, previous "1 → "2
dd       " Delete line 3 → "1, previous "1 → "2, previous "2 → "3

"1p      " Paste line 3
"2p      " Paste line 2  
"3p      " Paste line 1
```

<Note>
Small deletions (less than one line) go to the small delete register `"-` unless a register is explicitly specified.
</Note>

## Named Registers (a-z, A-Z)

Named registers are yours to use as you wish:

<CodeGroup>

```vim Basic usage
"ayy     " Yank line to register a
"add     " Delete line to register a (overwrites)
"ap      " Paste from register a
```

```vim Appending
"ayy     " Yank line to register a
"Ayy     " Append another line to register a
"ap      " Paste both lines
```

```vim Multiple named registers
"ayy     " Yank to register a
"byy     " Yank to register b
"cyy     " Yank to register c
"ap      " Paste from a
"bp      " Paste from b
"cp      " Paste from c
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Develop a system for named registers. For example:
- `"a` for temporary clipboard
- `"b` for boilerplate code
- `"c` for commonly used snippets
</Tip>

## Read-Only Registers

These registers contain useful information but cannot be written to directly:

### Last Command (":)

```vim
:echo "Hello"    " Execute command
":p              " Paste: echo "Hello"

" Useful for editing and re-running commands:
":    " Opens command-line with last command
```

### Last Insert (".)

```vim
iHello<Esc>      " Type and leave Insert mode
".p              " Paste: Hello

" Useful for repeating typed text in different locations
```

### Current Filename (%)

```vim
"%p              " Paste current filename with path
:echo @%         " Display current filename

" Useful in commands:
:!gcc %          " Compile current file
```

## Expression Register (=)

The expression register evaluates Vimscript expressions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Insert mode">
    ```vim
    " In Insert mode:
    <C-R>=2+2<CR>           " Insert: 4
    <C-R>=system('date')<CR> " Insert date
    <C-R>=@a<CR>            " Insert contents of register a
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Command-line mode">
    ```vim
    " In Command-line mode:
    :<C-R>=expand('%:t')<CR>  " Insert filename
    :<C-R>=line('.')<CR>      " Insert current line number
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Normal mode">
    ```vim
    " Calculate and paste:
    "=2*21<CR>p             " Paste: 42
    "=strftime('%Y')<CR>p   " Paste current year
    "=@a . @b<CR>p          " Concatenate registers a and b
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
The expression register is incredibly powerful for dynamic text generation and calculations.
</Info>

## System Clipboard Integration

### Clipboard vs Selection

On systems with X11 (Linux/Unix):

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Primary Selection (*)" icon="mouse-pointer">
    Selected text (middle-click paste).
    
    ```vim
    "*yy   " Copy to primary selection
    "*p    " Paste from primary selection
    ```
    
    Automatically updated when you select text.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Clipboard (+)" icon="clipboard">
    Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V clipboard.
    
    ```vim
    "+yy   " Copy to clipboard
    "+p    " Paste from clipboard
    ```
    
    Integrates with system copy/paste.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Checking Clipboard Support

```vim
:echo has('clipboard')        " Check if compiled with clipboard
:version                      " Look for +clipboard or +clipboard_provider
```

<Warning>
If Vim is compiled without clipboard support, the `"*` and `"+` registers won't work with the system clipboard.
</Warning>

### Clipboard Configuration

Set the `clipboard` option to change default paste behavior:

```vim
:set clipboard=unnamed        " Use * register
:set clipboard=unnamedplus    " Use + register
:set clipboard=unnamed,unnamedplus  " Use both
```

With `clipboard=unnamedplus`:
- Regular `yy` copies to system clipboard
- Regular `p` pastes from system clipboard

## The Black Hole Register (_)

The black hole register discards text without affecting other registers:

```vim
"_dd     " Delete line without saving
"_x      " Delete character without saving
"_d$     " Delete to end of line without saving
```

<Tip>
Use the black hole register when you want to delete something without overwriting your clipboard:
</Tip>

**Example workflow:**
```vim
yy       " Yank line you want to keep
"_dd     " Delete unwanted line (doesn't affect registers)
p        " Paste the line you yanked earlier
```

## Last Search Pattern Register (/)

Contains the last search pattern:

```vim
/pattern<CR>     " Search for 'pattern'
"/p              " Paste: pattern

" Set search pattern programmatically:
let @/ = "newpattern"
n                " Jump to next occurrence of 'newpattern'
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Swapping Two Lines

<Steps>
  <Step title="Delete first line">
    ```vim
    dd       " Delete first line → "1
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delete second line">
    ```vim
    dd       " Delete second line → "1, first line → "2
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Paste in reverse order">
    ```vim
    "2p      " Paste first line (now second)
    "1p      " Paste second line (now first)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example 2: Collecting Text from Multiple Locations

```vim
"ayy      " Yank first line to register a
/second<CR>
"Ayy      " Append second line to register a
/third<CR>
"Ayy      " Append third line to register a
"ap       " Paste all three lines
```

### Example 3: Using Expression Register for Calculations

```vim
" Calculate sum and insert:
i<C-R>=25 + 17<CR>  " Inserts: 42

" Insert current date:
i<C-R>=strftime('%Y-%m-%d')<CR>  " Inserts: 2024-01-15

" Insert line count:
i<C-R>=line('$')<CR>  " Inserts total line count
```

### Example 4: Macro Recording Uses Registers

<Info>
Macros are stored in registers! You can edit them as text.
</Info>

```vim
qq       " Start recording macro into register q
dd       " Delete line
j        " Move down
q        " Stop recording

:echo @q " Show macro contents: dd^Mj

" Edit the macro:
:let @q = 'dw'  " Change macro to delete word

@q       " Execute modified macro
```

## Register Access in Scripts

In Vimscript, access registers with `@` prefix:

```vim
" Read register
let text = @a
echo @+       " Show clipboard contents

" Write to register
let @a = "new text"
let @" = "set unnamed register"
let @+ = "copy to clipboard"

" Append to register
let @A = "append this"  " Uppercase appends
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Use "0 for last yank'>
    After yanking text, use `"0p` to paste it even after deleting something else.
    
    ```vim
    yy       " Yank line
    dd       " Delete another line
    "0p      " Paste the yank, not the deletion
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Black hole for non-destructive deletes">
    Delete without affecting registers using `"_`:
    
    ```vim
    yy       " Yank line
    "_dd     " Delete without overwriting yank
    p        " Paste the yank
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Named registers for common snippets">
    Store frequently used text in named registers:
    
    ```vim
    " In your vimrc:
    let @c = "Copyright 2024"
    let @e = "email@example.com"
    
    " Use anywhere:
    "cp      " Paste copyright text
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clipboard integration for system copy/paste">
    Set up clipboard for seamless integration:
    
    ```vim
    set clipboard=unnamedplus
    
    " Now yy/p work with system clipboard
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
