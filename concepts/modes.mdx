# Vim Modes

Vim has seven basic modes that fundamentally change how the editor responds to your keystrokes. Understanding these modes is essential to working effectively with Vim.

## The Seven Basic Modes

### Normal Mode

Normal mode (also called command mode) is the default mode when you start Vim. In this mode, you can:

- Navigate through your text
- Execute commands to manipulate text
- Enter other modes
- Use operators with motions

<Tip>
You can always return to Normal mode by pressing `<Esc>` twice.
</Tip>

When you start Vim, you're in Normal mode unless you've set the `insertmode` option. This mode is optimized for editing rather than writing, which is why all the powerful text manipulation commands are available here.

### Insert Mode

Insert mode is where you actually type text into your buffer. To enter Insert mode from Normal mode, use:

<CodeGroup>

```vim Commands to enter Insert mode
i    " Insert before cursor
I    " Insert at beginning of line
a    " Append after cursor
A    " Append at end of line
o    " Open new line below
O    " Open new line above
```

</CodeGroup>

When in Insert mode:
- The text you type is inserted into the buffer
- If `showmode` is on, "-- INSERT --" appears at the bottom
- Press `<Esc>` to return to Normal mode

<Info>
Insert mode has special key combinations like `CTRL-N` for completion and `CTRL-O` to execute a single Normal mode command.
</Info>

### Visual Mode

Visual mode allows you to select text before applying an operation. There are three variants:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Character-wise">
    **Start with:** `v`
    
    Select text character by character. Movement commands extend the selection. When `showmode` is on, "-- VISUAL --" appears at the bottom.
    
    ```vim
    v      " Start character-wise visual mode
    w      " Extend selection to next word
    d      " Delete selected text
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Line-wise">
    **Start with:** `V`
    
    Select entire lines. When `showmode` is on, "-- VISUAL LINE --" appears at the bottom.
    
    ```vim
    V      " Start line-wise visual mode
    3j     " Select 3 lines down
    >      " Indent selected lines
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Block-wise">
    **Start with:** `CTRL-V`
    
    Select a rectangular block of text. When `showmode` is on, "-- VISUAL BLOCK --" appears at the bottom.
    
    ```vim
    CTRL-V    " Start block-wise visual mode
    3j        " Move 3 lines down
    3l        " Move 3 characters right
    I         " Insert at start of each line
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
On Windows, `CTRL-V` might be mapped to paste. See the documentation for `CTRL-V-alternative` if this is an issue.
</Warning>

### Command-line Mode

Command-line mode (also called Cmdline mode) allows you to enter Ex commands, search patterns, and filter commands. You enter this mode by typing:

- `:` for Ex commands (e.g., `:w`, `:q`)
- `/` for forward search
- `?` for backward search
- `!` for filter commands

```vim
:set number          " Ex command to show line numbers
/pattern             " Search forward for 'pattern'
?pattern             " Search backward for 'pattern'
:.!sort              " Filter current line through 'sort'
```

You exit Command-line mode by:
- Pressing `<CR>` or `<NL>` to execute the command
- Pressing `CTRL-C` or `<Esc>` to cancel
- Deleting the entire line with `CTRL-U` and pressing `<BS>`

### Replace Mode

Replace mode is a special case of Insert mode where each character you type replaces an existing character. Start it with `R`.

```vim
R    " Enter Replace mode
```

When `showmode` is on, "-- REPLACE --" appears at the bottom. The backspace key restores the original text.

<Note>
There's also Virtual Replace mode (`gR`) which replaces screen space rather than actual characters, useful when dealing with tabs.
</Note>

### Ex Mode

Ex mode is entered with `Q` and allows you to enter multiple Ex commands without the `:` prefix. Use `:visual` or `:vi` to exit Ex mode.

```vim
Q          " Enter Ex mode
substitute/old/new/g
write
visual     " Return to Normal mode
```

<Warning>
Ex mode is rarely used in modern Vim workflows. The `Q` key is often remapped to format text with `gq`.
</Warning>

### Terminal-Job Mode

When interacting with a job in a terminal window, typed keys go to the job and job output is displayed in the terminal window. See `:help terminal` for details on switching to other modes.

## Mode Switching

Here's a reference table showing how to switch between modes:

| From Mode | To Mode | Key(s) |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Normal | Insert | `i`, `I`, `a`, `A`, `o`, `O`, `c`, `C`, `s`, `S` |
| Normal | Visual | `v`, `V`, `CTRL-V` |
| Normal | Command-line | `:`, `/`, `?`, `!` |
| Normal | Replace | `R`, `gR` |
| Normal | Ex | `Q` |
| Insert | Normal | `<Esc>` |
| Visual | Normal | `<Esc>`, `v`, `V`, `CTRL-V` (toggle) |
| Visual | Command-line | `:` |
| Command-line | Normal | `<CR>`, `<Esc>`, `CTRL-C` |
| Replace | Normal | `<Esc>` |
| Replace | Insert | `<Insert>` |
| Ex | Normal | `:visual` |

## Additional Modes

Vim has seven additional modes that are variants of the basic modes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Operator-pending Mode">
    After typing an operator like `d` or `c`, Vim waits for a motion. This is operator-pending mode.
    
    ```vim
    d    " Operator-pending mode begins
    w    " Motion completes the operation (delete word)
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Insert Normal Mode">
    Entered with `CTRL-O` in Insert mode. Execute one Normal mode command, then return to Insert mode.
    
    ```vim
    " In Insert mode:
    CTRL-O    " Enter Insert Normal mode
    w         " Move to next word
    " Automatically returns to Insert mode
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Visual Replace Mode">
    Similar to Replace mode but works with virtual screen space.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Terminal-Normal Mode">
    Using Normal mode in a terminal window. Changes are impossible. Use an insert command like `a` or `i` to return to Terminal-Job mode.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Universal Mode Escape

<Tip>
You can use `CTRL-\ CTRL-N` from any mode to return to Normal mode without causing a beep like `<Esc>` would. This doesn't work in Ex mode.
</Tip>

```vim
CTRL-\ CTRL-N    " Return to Normal mode from any mode
```

This is particularly useful in mappings and scripts where you need to ensure you're in Normal mode.

## Checking Current Mode

If you're unsure which mode you're in:

1. Look at the bottom of the screen (if `showmode` is on)
2. Press `<Esc>` twice to return to Normal mode
3. You'll see a screen flash or hear a bell when you reach Normal mode

<Info>
The `mode()` function in Vimscript returns the current mode as a string, useful for conditional logic in scripts.
</Info>

## Mode-Specific Mappings

You can create mappings that only work in specific modes:

```vim
:nmap     " Normal mode mapping
:imap     " Insert mode mapping
:vmap     " Visual and Select mode mapping
:xmap     " Visual mode only mapping
:smap     " Select mode only mapping
:cmap     " Command-line mode mapping
:omap     " Operator-pending mode mapping
```

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stay in Normal mode">
    Spend most of your time in Normal mode. Only enter Insert mode when you need to type text.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Learn the mode indicators">
    Enable `showmode` to always see which mode you're in:
    ```vim
    :set showmode
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Master mode switching">
    Make returning to Normal mode muscle memory. `<Esc>` should become your most-used key.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use operator-pending mode">
    Combine operators with motions (like `dw`, `ci"`, `y$`) instead of using Visual mode for simple operations.
  </Step>
</Steps>
