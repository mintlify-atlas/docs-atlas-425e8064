# First steps

Now that you can open files and make basic edits (see [Quickstart](/quickstart)), it's time to learn the commands that make Vim powerful.

<Note>
  All commands in this guide are executed in **normal mode** unless otherwise specified. Press `Esc` to ensure you're in normal mode before trying them.
</Note>

## Deleting text

Vim's delete commands follow a pattern: `[count][operator][motion]`

### Basic deletion

```vim
x       " Delete character under cursor
X       " Delete character before cursor
dw      " Delete from cursor to start of next word
de      " Delete from cursor to end of current word
db      " Delete from cursor to start of current word
dd      " Delete entire line
D       " Delete from cursor to end of line
```

### With counts

Add a number before commands to repeat them:

```vim
3x      " Delete 3 characters
2dw     " Delete 2 words
5dd     " Delete 5 lines
```

### Practical examples

<Steps>
  <Step title="Delete a word">
    Position cursor at the start of a word, then press `dw`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delete to end of line">
    Position cursor anywhere on a line, press `D`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delete multiple lines">
    Position cursor on first line, type `5dd` to delete 5 lines
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Deleted text goes into a register (Vim's clipboard). You can paste it back with `p` (paste after cursor) or `P` (paste before cursor).
</Tip>

## Copying and moving text

In Vim, copying is called "yanking":

### Yanking (copying)

```vim
yy      " Yank (copy) entire line
y$      " Yank from cursor to end of line  
yw      " Yank one word
3yy     " Yank 3 lines
y}      " Yank to end of paragraph
```

### Pasting

```vim
p       " Paste after cursor/line
P       " Paste before cursor/line
3p      " Paste 3 times
```

### Moving text

Delete and paste to move text:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Cut a line">
    Position cursor on the line and press `dd`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Move to destination">
    Navigate to where you want the line
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Paste">
    Press `p` to paste below, or `P` to paste above
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Changing text

The change operator deletes and enters insert mode:

```vim
cw      " Change word (delete word and enter insert mode)
c$      " Change to end of line
cc      " Change entire line
3cc     " Change 3 lines
C       " Change to end of line (same as c$)
s       " Substitute character (delete char and insert)
S       " Substitute line (same as cc)
```

### Replace

For quick single-character changes:

```vim
r       " Replace character under cursor (type new character)
R       " Enter replace mode (like insert, but overwrites)
```

**Example**: To change "hello" to "hallo":

1. Position cursor on the 'e'
2. Press `r`
3. Type `a`

## Visual mode

Visual mode lets you select text before operating on it:

### Entering visual mode

```vim
v       " Character-wise visual mode
V       " Line-wise visual mode
Ctrl-v  " Block-wise visual mode
```

### Using visual mode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter visual mode">
    Press `v` for character selection or `V` for line selection
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select text">
    Use movement keys (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `w`, `$`, etc.) to expand selection
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Operate on selection">
    - `d` - delete selection
    - `y` - yank (copy) selection
    - `c` - change selection
    - `>` - indent right
    - `<` - indent left
    - `u` - make lowercase
    - `U` - make uppercase
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Visual block mode

Visual block mode is powerful for columnar editing:

<CodeGroup>
```vim Select a column
1. Position cursor at top-left of block
2. Press Ctrl-v
3. Move cursor to bottom-right
4. Press d to delete, c to change, or y to copy
```

```vim Insert at multiple lines
1. Press Ctrl-v
2. Select lines (move down with j)
3. Press I (capital i)
4. Type text
5. Press Esc (text appears on all lines)
```
</CodeGroup>

**Example**: Add "//" comment to multiple lines:

1. Position cursor at start of first line
2. Press `Ctrl-v`
3. Move down with `j` to select lines
4. Press `I` (capital i)
5. Type `// `
6. Press `Esc`

## Searching

Search is one of Vim's most powerful features:

### Basic search

```vim
/pattern        " Search forward for pattern
?pattern        " Search backward for pattern
n               " Next match (same direction)
N               " Previous match (opposite direction)
*               " Search forward for word under cursor
#               " Search backward for word under cursor
```

### Search options

<CodeGroup>
```vim Case sensitivity
/word           " Case-sensitive search
/word\c         " Case-insensitive search (just this search)
:set ignorecase " Case-insensitive by default
:set smartcase  " Case-sensitive if pattern has uppercase
```

```vim Highlighting
:set hlsearch   " Highlight all matches
:set incsearch  " Show matches as you type
:noh            " Clear highlight until next search
```
</CodeGroup>

### Search and replace

The substitute command is very powerful:

```vim
:s/old/new/         " Replace first occurrence on current line
:s/old/new/g        " Replace all occurrences on current line
:%s/old/new/g       " Replace all occurrences in entire file
:%s/old/new/gc      " Replace all, but ask for confirmation
:5,12s/old/new/g    " Replace in lines 5-12
```

**Examples**:

<CodeGroup>
```vim Simple replacement
" Change all "color" to "colour"
:%s/color/colour/g
```

```vim Case-insensitive replacement  
" Change all "vim", "Vim", "VIM" to "Neovim"
:%s/vim/Neovim/gi
```

```vim With confirmation
" Replace with confirmation
:%s/old/new/gc
" You'll be prompted: y (yes), n (no), a (all), q (quit)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Undo and redo

Vim has powerful multi-level undo:

```vim
u           " Undo last change
U           " Undo all changes on current line
Ctrl-r      " Redo (undo the undo)
```

You can undo/redo repeatedly to move through your change history:

```vim
3u          " Undo last 3 changes
5Ctrl-r     " Redo last 5 undos
```

<Tip>
  Unlike Vi's single-level undo, Vim maintains a complete undo tree. You can even explore alternative editing paths with `:earlier` and `:later`.
</Tip>

## Repeating commands

The dot command is one of Vim's most powerful features:

```vim
.           " Repeat last change
```

**Example workflow**:

1. Delete a word: `dw`
2. Move to next location: `w`
3. Repeat deletion: `.`
4. Move again: `w`
5. Repeat: `.`

<Note>
  The `.` command repeats the last *change*, not the last movement. Movements don't affect what `.` will repeat.
</Note>

## Working with multiple files

### Buffers

Every file you open is loaded into a buffer:

```vim
:e filename     " Edit (open) a file
:bnext          " Next buffer (also :bn)
:bprev          " Previous buffer (also :bp)
:buffer 3       " Switch to buffer 3 (also :b3)
:buffers        " List all buffers (also :ls)
:bdelete        " Close current buffer (also :bd)
```

### Windows (splits)

Split your screen to view multiple files:

<CodeGroup>
```vim Horizontal splits
:split          " Split window horizontally (also :sp)
:split file.txt " Split and open file.txt
Ctrl-w s        " Split current window
```

```vim Vertical splits
:vsplit         " Split window vertically (also :vs)
:vsplit file.txt " Vertical split and open file.txt
Ctrl-w v        " Vertical split current window
```

```vim Navigate between windows
Ctrl-w h        " Move to window on left
Ctrl-w j        " Move to window below
Ctrl-w k        " Move to window above
Ctrl-w l        " Move to window on right
Ctrl-w w        " Cycle through windows
```

```vim Resize windows
Ctrl-w =        " Make windows equal size
Ctrl-w _        " Maximize current window height
Ctrl-w |        " Maximize current window width
:resize 20      " Set window height to 20 lines
```

```vim Close windows
:q              " Close current window
:only           " Close all windows except current
Ctrl-w c        " Close current window
```
</CodeGroup>

### Tabs

Tabs contain one or more windows:

```vim
:tabnew         " Open new tab
:tabedit file   " Open file in new tab
gt              " Next tab
gT              " Previous tab
:tabclose       " Close current tab (also :tabc)
:tabonly        " Close all tabs except current
```

## Basic configuration

Customize Vim by adding these to your `~/.vimrc` (Unix) or `$VIM/_vimrc` (Windows):

```vim ~/.vimrc
" Get sensible defaults
source $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim

" Display
set number              " Show line numbers
set relativenumber      " Show relative line numbers
set showcmd             " Show command in status line
set showmode            " Show current mode
set ruler               " Show cursor position
set cursorline          " Highlight current line

" Searching
set incsearch           " Incremental search
set hlsearch            " Highlight search results
set ignorecase          " Case-insensitive search
set smartcase           " Case-sensitive if uppercase present

" Indentation
set tabstop=4           " Tab width
set shiftwidth=4        " Indent width
set expandtab           " Use spaces instead of tabs
set autoindent          " Copy indent from current line

" Editing
set backspace=indent,eol,start  " Backspace over everything
set mouse=a             " Enable mouse in all modes
set clipboard=unnamed   " Use system clipboard

" Files
set backup              " Keep backup file
set undofile            " Persistent undo
set hidden              " Allow switching buffers without saving

" Performance
set lazyredraw          " Don't redraw during macros

" Visual
syntax on               " Enable syntax highlighting
filetype plugin indent on  " Enable file type detection
```

<Tip>
  Add settings gradually. Don't copy a huge vimrc until you understand what each option does. Start with the basics and add more as you learn.
</Tip>

## Essential key mappings

Create shortcuts for common operations:

```vim ~/.vimrc
" Map leader key (prefix for custom mappings)
let mapleader = ","

" Clear search highlight
nnoremap <leader><space> :noh<CR>

" Quick save
nnoremap <leader>w :w<CR>

" Quick quit
nnoremap <leader>q :q<CR>

" Easy window navigation
nnoremap <C-h> <C-w>h
nnoremap <C-j> <C-w>j
nnoremap <C-k> <C-w>k
nnoremap <C-l> <C-w>l

" Move lines up and down
nnoremap <A-j> :m .+1<CR>==
nnoremap <A-k> :m .-2<CR>==
```

<Note>
  `nnoremap` creates a non-recursive normal mode mapping. The `<leader>` key (comma in example above) acts as a prefix for your custom commands.
</Note>

## Command-line tricks

### Ranges

Many commands accept line ranges:

```vim
:5,10d          " Delete lines 5-10
:5,10y          " Yank lines 5-10
:.,$d           " Delete from current line to end
:1,.y           " Yank from line 1 to current line
:%d             " Delete all lines (% means 1,$)
:g/pattern/d    " Delete all lines matching pattern
:v/pattern/d    " Delete all lines NOT matching pattern
```

### Command history

```vim
:               " Start command mode
<Up>/<Down>     " Browse command history
q:              " Open command history window
```

### External commands

Run shell commands without leaving Vim:

```vim
:!ls            " Run 'ls' command
:!make          " Run 'make'
:r !date        " Insert output of 'date' command
:.!sort         " Filter current line through 'sort'
```

## Next steps

You now have the essential skills to edit efficiently in Vim. To continue learning:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Practice exercises

To build muscle memory:

1. **Daily editing**: Use Vim for all text editing for at least 2 weeks
2. **Vimtutor**: Complete it multiple times: `vimtutor`
3. **Learn one command per day**: Pick a new command from `:help quickref`
4. **Read help files**: Explore `:help` for topics that interest you
5. **Join the community**: Visit `/r/vim` on Reddit or `#vim` on Libera.Chat IRC

<Tip>
  Don't try to learn everything at once. Master one concept before moving to the next. Vim has a steep learning curve, but the investment pays off with years of productive editing.
</Tip>

## Common workflows

### Refactoring variable names

```vim
" Rename all occurrences of 'oldName' to 'newName'
:%s/\<oldName\>/newName/gc
```

The `\<` and `\>` match word boundaries, and `c` asks for confirmation.

### Editing multiple lines

```vim
" Add semicolon to end of multiple lines:
1. Ctrl-v to enter visual block mode
2. Select lines with j
3. Press $ to go to end of lines
4. Press A (capital A)
5. Type ;
6. Press Esc
```

### Working with code

```vim
=           " Auto-indent (with visual selection or motion)
==          " Auto-indent current line
=}          " Auto-indent paragraph
=%          " Auto-indent code block (cursor on bracket)
gq          " Format text (with visual selection or motion)
gqap        " Format paragraph
```

### Macros for repetitive edits

Record and replay sequences of commands:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start recording">
    Press `qa` to record into register 'a'
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Perform actions">
    Execute the commands you want to repeat
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Stop recording">
    Press `q`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Replay macro">
    Press `@a` to execute macro from register 'a'
    
    Use `@@` to repeat the last macro
    
    Use `10@a` to execute macro 10 times
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example**: Add quotes around words:

1. Position cursor on word
2. Press `qa` (start recording to register a)
3. Press `i"` (insert quote before word)
4. Press `Esc` (return to normal mode)
5. Press `ea"` (append quote after word)
6. Press `Esc`
7. Press `w` (move to next word)
8. Press `q` (stop recording)
9. Press `@a` to repeat on next word
10. Press `@@` to repeat again

<Tip>
  Macros are one of Vim's superpowers. They let you automate complex edits across hundreds of lines with just a few keystrokes.
</Tip>

## Getting help

Vim's built-in help is excellent:

```vim
:help               " Open main help
:help i_CTRL-R      " Help for Ctrl-R in insert mode
:help :substitute   " Help for substitute command
:help 'number'      " Help for 'number' option
:help tips          " Helpful tips
:help user-manual   " Full user manual
:helpgrep pattern   " Search all help files
```

Inside help:
- `Ctrl-]` - Jump to tag under cursor
- `Ctrl-o` - Jump back
- `:q` - Close help window
