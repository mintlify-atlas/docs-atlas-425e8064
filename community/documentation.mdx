---

Good documentation is essential to Vim's success. This guide covers the principles and practices for contributing to Vim's documentation.

## Documentation Philosophy

<Warning>
A feature that isn't documented is a useless feature. A patch for a new feature must include the documentation.
</Warning>

Key principles:

- **Comprehensive and understandable**: Cover all aspects clearly
- **Use examples**: Show practical usage
- **Be concise**: Less documentation means items are easier to find
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow established patterns and style

## Documentation Structure

Vim's documentation is located in `runtime/doc/` and consists of:

- **Help files** (`*.txt`): Core documentation with special formatting
- **Man pages** (`*.1`): Unix manual pages
- **README files**: Supplementary information for various features

## Help File Format

Vim help files use a special format that makes them easy to navigate and search.

### File Header

Every help file should start with a standard header:

```vim
*filename.txt*  For Vim version 9.2.  Last change: 2026 Feb 20


                  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Author Name


Title of the help file                                  *feature-name*
```

### Tags and Cross-References

Tags allow users to jump to specific topics:

```vim
*tag-name*
```

Rules for tags:
- Placed between asterisks: `*tag-name*`
- Should be unique across all help files
- Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `*word-motions*`)
- Command tags include the colon (e.g., `*:help*`)
- Option tags include quotes (e.g., `*'number'*`)

### Section Structure

Organize content into clear sections:

```vim
==============================================================================
1. Introduction                                         *feature-intro*

Introductory text about the feature...

==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                *feature-usage*

How to use the feature...

==============================================================================
3. Options                                              *feature-options*

Available options...
```

### Text Formatting

#### Emphasis and Special Text

- Commands: Indent and use syntax highlighting via tags
- Options: Reference with single quotes: `'number'`
- Commands: Reference with colon: `:help`
- Keys: Use angle brackets: `<Esc>`, `<C-W>`, `<CR>`
- Examples: Indent with 8 spaces or a tab
- Notes: Use `Note:` at the start of a line

#### Example Code Blocks

```vim
Example: >
    " This is example code
    set number
    set relativenumber
<
```

The `>` starts an example block, and `<` ends it.

#### Inline Code

Inline code doesn't need special markers but should be indented:

```vim
Use the following command:
        :set number
```

### Column Alignment

Help files use fixed-width alignment:

```vim
OPTION          DESCRIPTION                             DEFAULT
'number'        Show line numbers                       off
'relativenumber' Show relative line numbers             off
'wrap'          Wrap long lines                         on
```

### Lists

Use consistent list formatting:

```vim
Options:
- First option: description
- Second option: description
- Third option: description
```

Or numbered:

```vim
Steps:
1. First step
2. Second step  
3. Third step
```

### Warning and Note Boxes

```vim
                                                        *E123*
Note: This is an important note about the feature.

Warning: This operation cannot be undone.
```

Error messages get their own tag (e.g., `*E123*`).

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Be Clear and Concise

<Tip>
Get to the point quickly. Users want information, not prose.
</Tip>

**Good:**
```vim
The 'number' option displays line numbers in the left margin.
```

**Not as good:**
```vim
When you enable the 'number' option, Vim will display line numbers
in a margin area on the left side of the window, which can be very
helpful when you need to reference specific lines.
```

### Use Active Voice

**Good:** "Use `:help` to open the help system"

**Not as good:** "The help system can be opened with `:help`"

### Provide Examples

Examples clarify complex concepts:

```vim
To delete from the cursor to the end of the line: >
    d$
<
To delete the entire line: >
    dd
<
To delete 5 lines: >
    5dd
<
```

### Document All Parameters

For functions and commands:

```vim
                                                *function_name()*
function_name({arg1}, {arg2} [, {arg3}])
        Description of what the function does.
        
        {arg1}  Description of first argument
        {arg2}  Description of second argument
        {arg3}  Optional third argument
        
        Return value: What the function returns
        
        Example: >
            let result = function_name('foo', 42)
<
```

### Cross-Reference Related Topics

Help users discover related information:

```vim
See also:
        |related-topic-1|
        |related-topic-2|
        |:command-name|
```

## Documenting New Features

When adding a new feature, follow this checklist:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose the Right File">
    Add documentation to the appropriate help file:
    
    - **Commands**: `various.txt` or feature-specific file
    - **Options**: `options.txt`
    - **Functions**: `eval.txt` or feature-specific file
    - **New subsystem**: Create a new `feature.txt` file
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Tags">
    Create unique tags for:
    - The feature itself
    - Each command
    - Each option
    - Each function
    - Each error message
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Write Overview">
    Start with a brief overview explaining:
    - What the feature does
    - Why it's useful
    - Basic usage
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Document Details">
    Provide complete information:
    - All commands and their arguments
    - All options and their values
    - All functions and their parameters
    - Examples of common use cases
    - Edge cases and limitations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Examples">
    Include practical examples showing:
    - Basic usage
    - Common scenarios
    - Advanced usage
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Cross-Reference">
    Link to related topics and acknowledge dependencies:
    - Required features
    - Related commands
    - See also sections
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Indexes">
    Add entries to:
    - `index.txt` - For commands
    - `quickref.txt` - For quick reference
    - Table of contents in the feature file
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Documentation Standards

### Line Length

Keep lines to 78 characters or less. This ensures readability in standard terminal windows.

### Whitespace

- Use tabs for indentation (following Vim's default)
- Don't leave trailing whitespace
- End files with a single newline

### Tags Placement

Tags should be right-aligned at column 78:

```vim
Section Title                                           *section-tag*
```

### Section Separators

Use 78 equal signs for major section breaks:

```vim
==============================================================================
```

## Documenting Commands

Standard format for commands:

```vim
                                                *:CommandName*
:CommandName[!] [args]  Description of what the command does.
                        Second line of description.
                        
                        [!] is optional, explanation of what it does
                        [args] explanation of arguments
                        
                        Example: >
                            :CommandName foo bar
<
```

## Documenting Options

Standard format for options:

```vim
                                        *'optionname'* *'opt'*
'optionname' 'opt'  {type}  (default {value})
                    global or local to {scope} |global-local|
                    {only available with |+feature|}
    Description of what the option does and how it affects Vim.
    
    Example: >
        set optionname=value
<
```

## Documenting Functions

Standard format for functions:

```vim
                                                *function_name()*
function_name({arg1}, {arg2} [, {arg3}])
        Brief description of what the function does.
        
        Arguments:
            {arg1}  Description of arg1 (type)
            {arg2}  Description of arg2 (type)
            {arg3}  Optional description (type, default: value)
        
        Returns: Description of return value (type)
        
        Can also be used as a |method|: >
            GetValue()->function_name(arg2)
<
        Return type: |Type|
        
        Example: >
            let result = function_name('foo', 42)
            echo result
<
```

## Error Messages

Document all error messages:

```vim
                                                        *E123*
E123: Error message text
        Explanation of what causes this error and how to fix it.
        
        Example of code that triggers this error: >
            :command that fails
<
```

## Feature Dependencies

Clearly mark features that require compilation options:

```vim
{only available when compiled with the |+feature| feature}
```

or

```vim
{not available when compiled with |+feature|}
```

## Platform-Specific Documentation

Mark platform-specific features:

```vim
{only available on Unix}
{only available on MS-Windows}
{not available on Amiga}
```

## Testing Documentation

After writing documentation:

### Check Syntax

```bash
# Check for common documentation errors
vim -u NONE -c 'helptags runtime/doc' -c quit
```

### Verify Tags

Ensure all tags are unique and properly formatted:

```bash
cd runtime/doc
vim tags
```

### Check References

Verify all cross-references work:

```vim
:help your-new-tag
:help related-tag
```

### Test Examples

Run all code examples to ensure they work as documented.

## Translations

Help files can be translated:

- Translations live in `runtime/doc/{language}/`
- Maintain the same structure as English files
- Keep tags in English for consistency
- See `runtime/doc/translate.txt` for details

## Documentation Style Examples

### Good Documentation

```vim
*feature.txt*   For Vim version 9.2.  Last change: 2026 Feb 20

                  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Author Name

Awesome Feature                                         *awesome-feature*

1. Introduction                 |awesome-intro|
2. Usage                        |awesome-usage|
3. Commands                     |awesome-commands|
4. Options                      |awesome-options|

==============================================================================
1. Introduction                                         *awesome-intro*

The awesome feature adds powerful new capabilities to Vim.
{only available with the |+awesome| feature}

To enable: >
    set awesome=on
<
==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                *awesome-usage*

Use |:Awesome| to activate the feature: >
    :Awesome foo bar
<
```

## Common Documentation Mistakes

❌ **Don't:**
- Use personal pronouns (I, we, you)
- Include version-specific information without dates
- Leave TODO comments in committed docs
- Use abbreviations without defining them
- Forget to update the "Last change" date

✅ **Do:**
- Use imperative mood ("Use this command")
- Include the date with version info
- Complete all documentation before committing
- Define abbreviations on first use
- Update dates when modifying files
