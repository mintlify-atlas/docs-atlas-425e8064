## Getting Help Effectively

### Before Asking

1. **Search the built-in help**: Use `:help <keyword>` or `:helpgrep <pattern>`
2. **Check the FAQ**: See the [FAQ page](/community/faq) for common questions
3. **Search online**: Many problems have been solved before
4. **Try to reproduce**: Isolate the problem with a minimal configuration

### When Asking for Help

Provide the following information:

- **Vim version**: Output of `:version`
- **Operating system**: Windows, macOS, Linux distribution
- **Configuration**: Relevant parts of your vimrc
- **Reproduction steps**: Minimal steps to reproduce the issue
- **Expected vs actual behavior**: What you expected and what happened
- **Error messages**: Complete error messages if any

### Minimal vimrc Example

When troubleshooting, test with a minimal configuration:

```vim
" Save as minimal.vim
set nocompatible
filetype plugin indent on
syntax on

" Add only the relevant settings here
```

Then start Vim with:

```bash
vim -u minimal.vim
```
