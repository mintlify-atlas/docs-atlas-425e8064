description: Learn how to contribute patches, report issues, and participate in Vim development

Patches are welcome in whatever form. Discussions about patches happen on the vim-dev mailing list. If you create a pull request on GitHub it will be forwarded to the vim-dev mailing list.

## Getting Started

Contributions will be distributed with Vim under the Vim license. Providing a change to be included implies that you agree with this and your contribution does not cause us trouble with trademarks or patents. There is no CLA to sign.

### Where to Contribute

- **GitHub Pull Requests**: Create a PR on the [Vim repository](https://github.com/vim/vim)
- **vim-dev Mailing List**: Send patches directly (initial posting subject to moderation)
- **Issues**: Report bugs and problems on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues)

<Info>
A pull request has the advantage that it will trigger the Continuous Integration tests, you will be warned of problems (you can ignore the coverage warning, it's noisy).
</Info>

## Contribution Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the code">
    Clone the Vim repository from GitHub. This makes it easier to keep your changed version in sync with the main code base.
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
    cd vim
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Adjust the documentation">
    Update the documentation first. This gives you an impression of how your changes affect the user.
    
    - Check if your change affects any items listed in `runtime/doc/todo.txt`
    - Follow the documentation style guide in `runtime/doc/helphelp.txt`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make source code changes">
    Implement your changes following the [coding style guidelines](/community/development#coding-style).
    
    - Use the distributed `.editorconfig` file with the editorconfig plugin
    - Follow the C95 standard with select C99 features
    - Maintain consistency with surrounding code
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add tests">
    Please always add a test, if possible. All new functionality should be tested and bug fixes should be tested for regressions: the test should fail before the fix and pass after the fix.
    
    ```bash
    # Tests are located in src/testdir
    cd src/testdir
    # Look at recent tests for examples
    ```
    
    See `:help testing` for more information.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a patch">
    Make a patch with git diff and create a pull request on GitHub.
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -s -m "Brief description of changes"
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit for review">
    Open a pull request with an explanation of the changes. Include:
    
    - A clear description of the problem and solution
    - References to related issues
    - Test results
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Pull Request Guidelines

A PR should ideally contain a single commit for a single logical change. However, you can include several commits if you want to group multiple logical, atomic changes in one PR.

- Describe the reasoning for your changes in each commit message
- In cases where each commit handles different logical changes, they will be applied as separate patches
- Do not submit a single PR that addresses multiple unrelated issues

## Signing-off Commits

While not required, it's recommended to use **signed-off commits** to ensure transparency, accountability, and compliance with open-source best practices.

Signed-off commits follow the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin), which confirms that contributors have the right to submit their changes under the project's license.

```bash
git commit -s
```

This adds a `Signed-off-by` line to commit messages, verifying that the contributor agrees to the project's licensing terms.

<Note>
When merging PRs into Vim, the maintainer usually adds missing `Signed-off-by` trailers for contributors who explicitly ACK a pull request.
</Note>

## Using AI

When using AI for contributions, please disclose this. Any AI-generated code must follow the Vim code style.

<Warning>
Ensure that `test_codestyle.vim` does not report any failures. Check the CI output for any test failures.
</Warning>

Key requirements:
- Follow the Vim code style
- Properly test all changes
- Do not submit a single PR addressing multiple unrelated issues

## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub issues, but that is not a requirement. Writing to the Vim mailing list is also fine.

### Before Reporting

<Tip>
Please use GitHub issues only for actual issues. If you are not 100% sure that your problem is a Vim issue, first discuss this on the Vim user mailing list.
</Tip>

Try reproducing the problem without any of your plugins or settings:

```bash
vim --clean
```

### How to Report

If you report an issue, please describe exactly how to reproduce it. For example, don't say "insert some text" but say what you did exactly:

```vim
ahere is some text<Esc>
```

Ideally, the steps you list can be used to write a test to verify the problem is fixed.

Feel free to report even the smallest problem, also typos in the documentation. You can find known issues in the todo file: `:help todo`

## Runtime Files

### Syntax, Indent and Other Runtime Files

The latest version of these files can be obtained from the repository. They are usually not updated with numbered patches.

If you find a problem with one of these files or have a suggestion for improvement:

1. First try to contact the maintainer directly (check the file header or `MAINTAINERS` file)
2. If the maintainer does not respond, contact the vim-dev mailing list or open an issue

### Contributing New Runtime Files

If you want to contribute new runtime files for Vim or Neovim:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the files">
    Develop your syntax, indent, or ftplugin files following existing patterns.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add tests">
    Add a new filetype test in `src/testdir/test_filetype.vim` (keep it similar to other filetype tests).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Document configuration">
    All configuration switches should be documented. Check `runtime/doc/filetype.txt` and `runtime/doc/syntax.txt` for examples.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add maintainer info">
    - Add yourself as Maintainer to the top of file (keep the header similar to other runtime files)
    - Add yourself to the `MAINTAINERS` file
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ensure compatibility">
    Add a guard `if has('vim9script')` if you want to maintain Neovim compatibility but use Vim9 script.
    
    ```vim
    if has('vim9script')
        " use Vim9 script implementation
        [...]
    endif
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Translations

Translating messages and runtime files is very much appreciated! These things can be translated:

- **Messages in Vim**: See `src/po/README.txt` (also used for desktop icons)
- **Menus**: See `runtime/lang/README.txt`
- **Vim tutor**: See `runtime/tutor/README.txt`
- **Manual pages**: See `runtime/doc/*.1` for examples
- **Installer**: See `nsis/lang/README.txt`

The help files can be translated and made available separately. See [vim.org/translations](https://www.vim.org/translations.php) for examples.
