title: Windows and Tab Pages
description: Master Vim's window splitting and tab page management for efficient multi-pane editing
---

Vim's window and tab system allows you to view and edit multiple files (or different parts of the same file) simultaneously. Understanding windows and tabs is crucial for efficient navigation and workflow organization.

## Understanding the Layout

**Key Concept**: A **buffer** contains file content, a **window** is a viewport on a buffer, and a **tab page** is a collection of windows.

```vim
Buffer → Contains file text
Window → Viewport on a buffer
Tab Page → Collection of windows
```

You can have:
- Multiple windows showing the same buffer
- Multiple windows showing different buffers
- Multiple tab pages, each with their own window layout

## Split Windows

### Creating Splits

**Horizontal Splits** (stack vertically):

```vim
CTRL-W s         " Split current window horizontally
:split           " Same as above
:split file.txt  " Split and open file.txt
:10split         " Split with new window 10 lines high
:new             " Split with new empty buffer
```

**Vertical Splits** (side by side):

```vim
CTRL-W v         " Split current window vertically
:vsplit          " Same as above
:vsplit file.txt " Split vertically and open file.txt
:30vsplit        " Split with new window 30 columns wide
:vnew            " Vertical split with new empty buffer
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your first split">
    Open a file and split the window:
    ```vim
    :vsplit
    ```
    You'll see the same file in two side-by-side windows.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open a different file in split">
    Navigate to the split and open another file:
    ```vim
    CTRL-W w      " Move to other window
    :e file2.txt  " Open different file
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Experiment with movement">
    Practice moving between windows:
    ```vim
    CTRL-W h  " Move left
    CTRL-W l  " Move right
    CTRL-W j  " Move down
    CTRL-W k  " Move up
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Split Modifiers

Control where splits appear:

```vim
:aboveleft split     " Open above/left
:belowright split    " Open below/right
:topleft split       " Use full width/height at top/left
:botright split      " Use full width/height at bottom/right
:vertical topleft split  " Combine modifiers
```

<Tip>
Use `:vertical` to make horizontal split commands create vertical splits:
```vim
:vertical help windows
:vertical wincmd =
```
</Tip>

## Navigating Windows

### Moving Between Windows

```vim
" Arrow key style (hjkl)
CTRL-W h         " Move to window on left
CTRL-W j         " Move to window below
CTRL-W k         " Move to window above
CTRL-W l         " Move to window on right

" Sequential movement
CTRL-W w         " Move to next window (cycles)
CTRL-W W         " Move to previous window

" Position-based
CTRL-W t         " Move to top-left window
CTRL-W b         " Move to bottom-right window
CTRL-W p         " Move to previous (last accessed) window
```

<Note>
You can also click on a window with the mouse if `set mouse=a` is enabled.
</Note>

### Window Numbers

Each window has a number, shown in the status line. Jump directly:

```vim
:3wincmd w       " Jump to window 3
```

## Closing Windows

```vim
CTRL-W q         " Quit current window (same as :quit)
CTRL-W c         " Close current window (same as :close)
CTRL-W o         " Close all windows except current (same as :only)

:quit            " Quit window (may exit Vim if last window)
:close           " Close window (fails if last window)
:only            " Make current window the only one
:hide            " Quit window and hide buffer
```

<Warning>
`:quit!` or `CTRL-W q!` will discard changes. Use carefully!
</Warning>

## Resizing Windows

### Manual Resizing

**Height**:

```vim
CTRL-W +         " Increase height
CTRL-W -         " Decrease height
CTRL-W _         " Maximize height
:resize 20       " Set height to 20 lines
:resize +5       " Increase by 5 lines
:resize -5       " Decrease by 5 lines
```

**Width**:

```vim
CTRL-W >         " Increase width
CTRL-W <         " Decrease width
CTRL-W |         " Maximize width
:vertical resize 40    " Set width to 40 columns
:vertical resize +10   " Increase by 10 columns
```

**Equal Sizes**:

```vim
CTRL-W =         " Make all windows equal size
:vertical wincmd =     " Equalize only width
:horizontal wincmd =   " Equalize only height
```

<Tip>
You can drag window borders with the mouse if `set mouse=a` is enabled.
</Tip>

### Window Size Options

```vim
" Set minimum sizes
:set winheight=10    " Minimum height for current window
:set winwidth=20     " Minimum width for current window
:set winminheight=0  " Minimum height for non-current windows
:set winminwidth=0   " Minimum width for non-current windows

" Auto-equalize windows
:set equalalways     " Make windows equal when splitting/closing
:set noequalalways   " Keep manual sizes
```

## Moving and Rearranging Windows

### Rotating Windows

```vim
CTRL-W r         " Rotate windows downwards/rightwards
CTRL-W R         " Rotate windows upwards/leftwards
CTRL-W x         " Exchange with next window
```

### Repositioning Windows

Change window position and layout:

```vim
CTRL-W K         " Move window to top (full width)
CTRL-W J         " Move window to bottom (full width)
CTRL-W H         " Move window to far left (full height)
CTRL-W L         " Move window to far right (full height)
CTRL-W T         " Move window to new tab page
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create multiple splits">
    ```vim
    :split
    :vsplit
    :vsplit
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rearrange layout">
    Move to a window and try:
    ```vim
    CTRL-W K  " Move to top (becomes full-width horizontal)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extract to tab">
    Extract a window into its own tab:
    ```vim
    CTRL-W T
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tab Pages

Tab pages allow you to organize different window layouts for different tasks.

### Creating Tabs

```vim
:tabnew          " Open new tab with empty buffer
:tabnew file.txt " Open new tab with file
:tabedit file    " Same as :tabnew
:tabfind file    " Find file in 'path' and open in new tab

" Split into new tab
:tab split       " Open current buffer in new tab
:tab help windows " Open help in new tab

" Position-specific
:0tabnew         " Open tab before first tab
:$tabnew         " Open tab after last tab
:+tabnew         " Open tab after current
:-tabnew         " Open tab before current
```

Start Vim with tabs:

```bash
# Open each file in a tab
vim -p file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

### Navigating Tabs

```vim
gt               " Next tab (or CTRL-PageDown)
gT               " Previous tab (or CTRL-PageUp)
3gt              " Jump to tab 3
g<Tab>           " Last accessed tab

:tabnext         " Next tab (or :tabn)
:tabprevious     " Previous tab (or :tabp, :tabN)
:tabfirst        " First tab (or :tabfir)
:tablast         " Last tab (or :tabl)
:tabs            " List all tabs
```

<Tip>
In GUI Vim, you can click on tab labels to switch tabs or use the mouse wheel over the tab line.
</Tip>

### Managing Tabs

```vim
:tabclose        " Close current tab (or :tabc)
:tabonly         " Close all other tabs (or :tabo)
:tabclose 2      " Close tab 2
:1,3tabclose     " Close tabs 1-3

" Reorder tabs
:tabmove         " Move to end
:tabmove 0       " Move to beginning
:tabmove 3       " Move after tab 3
:tabmove +1      " Move one position right
:tabmove -1      " Move one position left
```

### Tab-Specific Commands

Execute a command in all tabs:

```vim
:tabdo {cmd}     " Execute cmd in each tab
:tabdo %s/old/new/ge  " Replace in all tabs
```

## Advanced Window Techniques

### Preview Window

A special window for previewing tags and definitions:

```vim
:ptag function   " Open tag in preview window
CTRL-W }         " Open tag under cursor in preview
CTRL-W z         " Close preview window (or :pclose)

:pedit file      " Edit file in preview window
:psearch pattern " Search and show in preview
```

Set preview window height:

```vim
:set previewheight=15
```

### Opening Files in Splits

```vim
" Split and open file under cursor
CTRL-W f         " Horizontal split
CTRL-W F         " Horizontal split, jump to line number
CTRL-W gf        " Open in new tab

" Split and open tag
CTRL-W ]         " Horizontal split, jump to tag
CTRL-W g]        " Horizontal split, select from matches
```

### Diff Mode in Windows

```vim
:vert diffsplit file2.txt  " Vertical diff
:diffsplit file2.txt       " Horizontal diff

" In split windows
:windo diffthis            " Start diff in all windows
:diffoff                   " Turn off diff
```

## Practical Workflows

### Side-by-Side Code Review

```vim
:vsplit original.c
CTRL-W w
:e modified.c
:windo diffthis
```

### Three-Way Merge

```vim
:e base.txt
:vsplit mine.txt
:vsplit theirs.txt
:windo diffthis
```

### Reference Window

Keep a reference file visible:

```vim
:topleft 10split notes.txt
:set winfixheight  " Keep height fixed
```

### Project Layout

Organize by task:

```vim
" Tab 1: Main code
:tabedit src/main.c
:vsplit src/utils.c

" Tab 2: Tests
:tabnew test/main_test.c
:split test/utils_test.c

" Tab 3: Documentation
:tabnew README.md
:vsplit CHANGELOG.md
```

## Status Line Configuration

Show useful info in window status lines:

```vim
" Show status line always
:set laststatus=2

" Custom status line
:set statusline=%f\ %h%w%m%r\ %=%(%l,%c%V\ %=\ %P%)

" Show tab line
:set showtabline=2  " 0=never, 1=if multiple tabs, 2=always
```

## Window-Local Settings

Some options are local to windows:

```vim
:setlocal number        " Only in current window
:setlocal scrollbind    " Link scrolling between windows
:setlocal cursorbind    " Link cursor position
```

Scroll binding example:

```vim
:split
:windo setlocal scrollbind
```

## Tips and Tricks

### Quick Split Shortcuts

Add to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
" Easier split navigation
nnoremap <C-J> <C-W>j
nnoremap <C-K> <C-W>k
nnoremap <C-L> <C-W>l
nnoremap <C-H> <C-W>h

" Easier split creation
nnoremap <Leader>v :vsplit<CR>
nnoremap <Leader>s :split<CR>

" Resize splits
nnoremap <Leader>+ :resize +5<CR>
nnoremap <Leader>- :resize -5<CR>
nnoremap <Leader>> :vertical resize +5<CR>
nnoremap <Leader>< :vertical resize -5<CR>
```

### Natural Split Opening

```vim
" Open splits below and right (more natural)
:set splitbelow
:set splitright
```

### Zoom Window Toggle

Create a "zoom" for focusing on one window:

```vim
function! ToggleZoom()
  if winnr('$') > 1
    tab split
  elseif tabpagenr('$') > 1
    tabclose
  endif
endfunction

nnoremap <Leader>z :call ToggleZoom()<CR>
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Use splits for files you're actively editing together</Check>
<Check>Use tabs to separate different contexts or projects</Check>
<Check>Set `:set splitbelow` and `:set splitright` for intuitive split behavior</Check>
<Check>Enable `:set mouse=a` for easier window resizing</Check>
<Check>Use `CTRL-W =` to fix window sizes after terminal resizes</Check>

<Warning>
Don't rely on tabs like browser tabs—Vim tabs are really "layouts" or "workspaces". Use buffers for file switching.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Window Too Small

If you get "Not enough room" errors:

```vim
:set winminheight=0
:set winminwidth=0
```

### Lost Window Focus

If you lose track of the current window:

```vim
:set cursorline  " Highlight current line
:set number      " Show line numbers
```
