- `<BS>` restores the original character
- All Insert mode special commands work the same way

## Virtual Replace Mode

Virtual Replace mode is entered with `gR` from Normal mode.

In Virtual Replace mode:
- Characters are replaced as if the screen is a single long line
- Tabs and spaces are replaced equally
- Useful for maintaining column alignment

## Insert Mode Options

Several options affect Insert mode behavior:

- `'textwidth'` - Maximum line width (automatic line breaking)
- `'autoindent'` - Copy indent from previous line
- `'smartindent'` - Smart autoindenting for C-like languages
- `'cindent'` - C-style indenting
- `'expandtab'` - Use spaces instead of tabs
- `'showmode'` - Display mode in status line
- `'insertmode'` - Start Vim in Insert mode
- `'paste'` - Paste mode (disables autoindent, etc.)

## Tips

1. **Quick Insert and Return**: Use `CTRL-O` to execute a single Normal mode command without leaving Insert mode.

2. **Smart Undo**: Use `CTRL-G u` before major edits to create undo break points.

3. **Completion**: Master `CTRL-N` and `CTRL-P` for quick word completion.

4. **Paste Mode**: Use `:set paste` before pasting from clipboard to avoid auto-indent issues.

5. **Expression Register**: Use `CTRL-R =` to insert results of calculations (e.g., `CTRL-R =2+2<CR>` inserts `4`).
