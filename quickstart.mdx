# Quickstart

This guide will get you editing files in Vim in under 5 minutes. If you're brand new to Vim, this is the place to start.

<Tip>
  The best way to learn Vim is by doing. Follow along with these examples by actually typing the commands in Vim.
</Tip>

## Before you start

Make sure Vim is installed. Run this in your terminal:

```bash
vim --version
```

If you see version information, you're ready to go. If not, see the [Installation](/installation) guide.

## Starting Vim

Open your terminal and start Vim:

```bash
vim
```

You'll see the Vim welcome screen. Don't panic - Vim is waiting for your commands.

<Note>
  To exit Vim at any time, press `Esc` to ensure you're in normal mode, then type `:q!` and press `Enter`. The `!` forces quit without saving.
</Note>

## Understanding modes

Vim operates in different modes. The two most important are:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Normal mode" icon="keyboard">
    For navigating and manipulating text. This is Vim's default mode. Press `Esc` to return here from any other mode.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Insert mode" icon="pen">
    For typing text like a regular editor. Press `i` to enter insert mode from normal mode.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

When you start Vim, you're in **normal mode**. To type text, press `i` to enter **insert mode**. You'll see `-- INSERT --` at the bottom of the screen.

## Your first edit

Let's create and edit a file:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a new file">
    ```bash
    vim hello.txt
    ```
    
    This opens `hello.txt` in Vim. If the file doesn't exist, Vim will create it when you save.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter insert mode">
    Press `i` to start inserting text. You should see `-- INSERT --` at the bottom.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Type some text">
    Type:
    ```
    Hello, Vim!
    This is my first file.
    ```
    
    Type naturally - all the normal keys work in insert mode.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Return to normal mode">
    Press `Esc` to exit insert mode. The `-- INSERT --` indicator disappears.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save the file">
    Type `:w` and press `Enter`. The `:w` command writes (saves) the file.
    
    ```vim
    :w
    ```
    
    You'll see a message like: `"hello.txt" 2L, 37C written`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Exit Vim">
    Type `:q` and press `Enter` to quit.
    
    ```vim
    :q
    ```
    
    Or use `:wq` to write and quit in one command.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You can combine write and quit: `:wq` saves and exits in one command. Even shorter: `:x` or `ZZ` (in normal mode).
</Tip>

## Essential commands

Here are the commands you'll use constantly:

### Opening and saving files

<CodeGroup>
```vim Opening files
:e filename      " Edit a file
:e!              " Reload current file (discard changes)
vim file1 file2  " Open multiple files (from terminal)
```

```vim Saving files
:w               " Write (save) current file
:w filename      " Save as filename
:w!              " Force write (if file is read-only)
:wa              " Write all open files
```

```vim Quitting
:q               " Quit (fails if unsaved changes)
:q!              " Quit without saving
:wq              " Write and quit
:x               " Write if changed, then quit
ZZ               " Save and quit (normal mode)
ZQ               " Quit without saving (normal mode)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Basic navigation

In **normal mode**, use these keys to move around:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Basic movement">
    - `h` - left
    - `j` - down  
    - `k` - up
    - `l` - right
    
    You can also use arrow keys, but `hjkl` is faster once you learn them.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Faster movement">
    - `w` - jump forward to start of next word
    - `b` - jump backward to start of word
    - `e` - jump to end of word
    - `0` - jump to start of line
    - `$` - jump to end of line
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Jumping around">
    - `gg` - go to first line
    - `G` - go to last line
    - `5G` - go to line 5
    - `{` - jump to previous paragraph
    - `}` - jump to next paragraph
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Screen movement">
    - `Ctrl-f` - page down
    - `Ctrl-b` - page up
    - `Ctrl-d` - half page down
    - `Ctrl-u` - half page up
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Entering insert mode

There are several ways to enter insert mode:

```vim
i    " Insert before cursor
a    " Append after cursor
I    " Insert at beginning of line
A    " Append at end of line
o    " Open new line below and insert
O    " Open new line above and insert
```

## Practical example

Let's edit a real file with a complete workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a shopping list">
    ```bash
    vim shopping.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add items">
    1. Press `i` to enter insert mode
    2. Type:
    ```
    Shopping List
    - Milk
    - Bread
    - Eggs
    ```
    3. Press `Esc` to return to normal mode
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate and add more items">
    1. Press `G` to jump to the last line
    2. Press `o` to open a new line below and enter insert mode
    3. Type: `- Cheese`
    4. Press `Esc`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make a correction">
    1. Press `gg` to go to the first line
    2. Press `j` to move down one line (to "Milk")
    3. Press `A` to append at end of line
    4. Type: ` (2 cartons)`
    5. Press `Esc`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and exit">
    Type `:wq` and press `Enter`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting help

Vim has extensive built-in documentation. Access it with the `:help` command:

```vim
:help               " Open help
:help i             " Help for 'i' command
:help :w            " Help for ':w' command
:help modes         " Help about modes
:help user-manual   " Open user manual
```

<Tip>
  Inside help, press `Ctrl-]` on a highlighted word to jump to that topic, and `Ctrl-o` to jump back.
</Tip>

## Running the Vim tutor

Vim includes an interactive tutorial that teaches you the basics through hands-on practice:

```bash
vimtutor
```

Or from within Vim:

```vim
:help tutor
```

The tutor takes about 30 minutes and is the best way to learn Vim's core commands.

## Common pitfalls

<Warning>
  **You're stuck in insert mode**: Press `Esc` to return to normal mode. If nothing else works, press `Esc` a few times.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Commands aren't working**: Make sure you're in normal mode (press `Esc`). Commands only work in normal mode.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Can't exit Vim**: From normal mode (press `Esc`), type `:q!` to quit without saving, or `:wq` to save and quit.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Accidentally recording**: If you see "recording @q" at the bottom, you pressed `q` in normal mode. Press `q` again to stop recording.
</Warning>
