## Search and Replace Mastery

### The Substitute Command

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basic Substitution Syntax">
    Format: `:range s/pattern/replacement/flags`
    
    **Common patterns:**
    ```vim
    :s/old/new/           " Replace first occurrence in line
    :s/old/new/g          " Replace all in line (global)
    :s/old/new/gc         " Replace all with confirmation
    :s/old/new/i          " Case-insensitive
    :s/old/new/gi         " Global + case-insensitive
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    The `g` flag means "global within the line" - replace all occurrences, not just the first.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Range Specifications">
    Control which lines are affected:
    
    | Range | Meaning | Example |
    |-------|---------|----------|
    | `:s/a/b/` | Current line only | Single line |
    | `:%s/a/b/` | Entire file | All lines |
    | `:1,10s/a/b/` | Lines 1-10 | Specific range |
    | `:.,$s/a/b/` | Current to end | Current onwards |
    | `:'<,'>s/a/b/` | Visual selection | Selected text |
    | `:g/pattern/s/a/b/` | Lines matching pattern | Conditional |
    
    **Special markers:**
    ```vim
    :.     " Current line
    :$     " Last line
    :%     " All lines
    :'<,'> " Visual selection (auto-inserted)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Replacement Patterns">
    Use special characters in replacement:
    
    | Pattern | Meaning | Example |
    |---------|---------|----------|
    | `&` | Entire match | `:s/word/(&)/` → "(word)" |
    | `\0` | Entire match | Same as `&` |
    | `\1` | First capture group | `:s/\(\w\+\)/[\1]/` |
    | `\2` | Second capture group | Multiple captures |
    | `\u` | Uppercase next char | `:s/\w/\u&/` → "Word" |
    | `\U` | Uppercase rest | `:s/.*/\U&/` → "WORD" |
    | `\l` | Lowercase next char | `:s/\w/\l&/` → "wORD" |
    | `\L` | Lowercase rest | `:s/.*/\L&/` → "word" |
    | `\r` | Insert newline | Split lines |
    | `\t` | Insert tab | Add indentation |
    
    **Examples:**
    ```vim
    :%s/\w\+/"&"/g        " Quote all words
    :%s/\(\w\+\)/\U\1/g   " UPPERCASE all words
    :%s/^/  /             " Indent all lines with 2 spaces
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Capture Groups and Backreferences">
    Extract and reuse parts of the match:
    
    **Swap first and last name:**
    ```vim
    :%s/\(\w\+\) \(\w\+\)/\2, \1/
    ```
    Result: "John Smith" → "Smith, John"
    
    **Extract version number:**
    ```vim
    :s/version \(\d\+\.\d\+\)/v\1/
    ```
    Result: "version 2.5" → "v2.5"
    
    **Reformat function calls:**
    ```vim
    :%s/\(\w\+\)(\(.*\))/\1[\2]/
    ```
    Result: "func(args)" → "func[args]"
    
    <Note>
    Use `\(` and `\)` to create capture groups. Reference with `\1`, `\2`, etc.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Interactive Confirmation">
    Review each replacement:
    
    ```vim
    :%s/old/new/gc
    ```
    
    **Confirmation prompts:**
    - `y` - Yes, replace this match
    - `n` - No, skip this match
    - `a` - All, replace this and all remaining
    - `q` - Quit, stop replacing
    - `l` - Last, replace this and quit
    - `CTRL-E` - Scroll up
    - `CTRL-Y` - Scroll down
    
    <Tip>
    Use `gc` when you're not 100% sure about replacing everything. You can always press `a` to accept the rest.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Advanced Search Patterns

<Steps>
  <Step title="Regex Patterns">
    Vim's regex engine syntax:
    
    | Pattern | Matches | Example |
    |---------|---------|----------|
    | `.` | Any character | `c.t` matches "cat", "cot" |
    | `*` | 0 or more | `ca*t` matches "ct", "cat", "caat" |
    | `\+` | 1 or more | `ca\+t` matches "cat", "caat" |
    | `\?` | 0 or 1 | `ca\?t` matches "ct", "cat" |
    | `\{n,m\}` | n to m times | `a\{2,4\}` matches "aa", "aaa", "aaaa" |
    | `^` | Start of line | `^The` matches "The" at line start |
    | `$` | End of line | `end$` matches "end" at line end |
    | `\<` | Word start | `\<vim` matches "vim" not "gvim" |
    | `\>` | Word end | `vim\>` matches "vim" not "vimrc" |
    | `\|` | Alternation (OR) | `cat\|dog` matches "cat" or "dog" |
    | `[abc]` | Character class | `[aeiou]` matches any vowel |
    | `[^abc]` | Negated class | `[^0-9]` matches non-digit |
    | `\w` | Word character | `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` |
    | `\W` | Non-word | `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]` |
    | `\d` | Digit | `[0-9]` |
    | `\D` | Non-digit | `[^0-9]` |
    | `\s` | Whitespace | Space, tab, newline |
    | `\S` | Non-whitespace | Any non-space |
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Common Pattern Examples">
    **Match email addresses:**
    ```vim
    /\w\+@\w\+\.\w\+
    ```
    
    **Match URLs:**
    ```vim
    /https\?:\/\/[^[:space:]]\+
    ```
    
    **Match hex colors:**
    ```vim
    /#\x\{6\}
    ```
    
    **Match IP addresses:**
    ```vim
    /\d\{1,3\}\.\d\{1,3\}\.\d\{1,3\}\.\d\{1,3\}
    ```
    
    **Match function definitions (Python):**
    ```vim
    /^def \w\+(.*):$
    ```
    
    **Match commented lines:**
    ```vim
    /^\s*#
    /^\s*\/\/ 
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Very Magic Mode">
    Simplify regex with `\v` (very magic):
    
    ```vim
    " Traditional Vim regex
    /\(\d\+\)\.\(\d\+\)
    
    " Very magic mode
    /\v(\d+)\.(\d+)
    ```
    
    In very magic mode:
    - No need to escape `()`, `+`, `|`, etc.
    - More like Perl/Python regex
    - Easier to read and write
    
    **Example transformations:**
    ```vim
    " Find function calls: func(arg1, arg2)
    /\v\w+\(.*\)
    
    " Find URLs
    /\vhttps?://\S+
    
    " Find phone numbers
    /\v\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Case Sensitivity Control">
    Control case matching:
    
    ```vim
    /pattern      " Depends on 'ignorecase' setting
    /pattern\c    " Force case-insensitive
    /pattern\C    " Force case-sensitive
    ```
    
    **Settings:**
    ```vim
    :set ignorecase   " Ignore case in searches
    :set smartcase    " Case-sensitive if uppercase present
    :set noignorecase " Case-sensitive always
    ```
    
    With `smartcase` on:
    - `/vim` matches "vim", "Vim", "VIM"
    - `/Vim` matches "Vim" only
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Global Commands

### The :global Command

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basic Global Syntax">
    Format: `:g/pattern/command`
    
    Execute command on lines matching pattern:
    
    ```vim
    :g/TODO/d          " Delete all lines with TODO
    :g/^$/d            " Delete all empty lines
    :g/pattern/p       " Print matching lines
    :g/debug/normal gcc  " Comment out debug lines
    ```
    
    **Inverted (non-matching):**
    ```vim
    :g!/pattern/command  " Lines NOT matching
    :v/pattern/command   " Same as g! (v for inVerse)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Global with Operations">
    **Delete operations:**
    ```vim
    :g/^$/d                " Delete blank lines
    :g/DEBUG/d             " Delete debug statements
    :g/^#/d                " Delete comments
    :v/TODO\|FIXME/d       " Keep only TODO/FIXME lines
    ```
    
    **Yank operations:**
    ```vim
    :g/error/yank A        " Yank all error lines to register a
    :g/function/t$         " Copy function lines to end
    ```
    
    **Move operations:**
    ```vim
    :g/import/m 0          " Move all imports to top
    :g/^$/m $              " Move blank lines to end
    ```
    
    **Substitute on matching lines:**
    ```vim
    :g/TODO/s/TODO/DONE/   " Replace TODO with DONE on TODO lines
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complex Global Commands">
    **Multi-line operations:**
    ```vim
    :g/^class/+1,/^}/d     " Delete class bodies
    :g/function/.,/^}/s/^/  /  " Indent function bodies
    ```
    
    **Nested commands:**
    ```vim
    :g/pattern/normal @a   " Run macro 'a' on matching lines
    :g/TODO/normal A !     " Append ! to TODO lines
    ```
    
    **Conditional operations:**
    ```vim
    :g/^def/if getline('.')[4:6] == 'old' | d | endif
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Real-World Examples">
    **Remove duplicate lines:**
    ```vim
    :sort u                " Sort and remove duplicates (simple)
    :g/^\(.*\)$\n\1$/d    " Remove adjacent duplicates (complex)
    ```
    
    **Extract function definitions:**
    ```vim
    :g/^def/yank A         " Collect all Python functions
    :g/^function/yank A    " Collect all JS functions
    ```
    
    **Format code blocks:**
    ```vim
    :g/^class/normal =i{   " Auto-indent class bodies
    ```
    
    **Add line numbers to errors:**
    ```vim
    :let n=0 | g/ERROR/let n+=1 | s/^/[n] /
    ```
    
    **Reverse lines matching pattern:**
    ```vim
    :g/pattern/m 0         " Move matching lines to top (reverses order)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Macros: Record and Replay

### Recording Macros

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basic Macro Recording">
    Record a sequence of commands:
    
    ```vim
    qa        " Start recording to register 'a'
    "...commands..."
    q         " Stop recording
    
    @a        " Execute macro once
    @@        " Repeat last macro
    10@a      " Execute 10 times
    ```
    
    **Example: Format list items**
    ```vim
    qa        " Start recording
    I- <ESC>  " Insert '- ' at line start
    j         " Move to next line
    q         " Stop recording
    
    10@a      " Apply to next 10 lines
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Editing Macros">
    Macros are just text in registers:
    
    **View macro contents:**
    ```vim
    :reg a    " Show register 'a' contents
    ```
    
    **Edit macro:**
    ```vim
    "ap       " Paste macro to buffer
    "...edit..."
    "ayy      " Yank back to register
    ```
    
    **Or edit in command line:**
    ```vim
    :let @a='I- ^[j'   " ^[ is ESC (type CTRL-V ESC)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Advanced Macro Techniques">
    **Recursive macros:**
    ```vim
    qa        " Start recording
    "...operations..."
    @a        " Call macro recursively
    q         " Stop recording
    
    @a        " Execute (runs until error)
    ```
    
    **Example: Process entire file**
    ```vim
    qa        " Start recording
    ^i" <ESC> " Quote first word
    w         " Move to next word
    @a        " Call self
    q         " Stop recording
    
    @a        " Quotes all words until file end
    ```
    
    <Warning>
    Recursive macros stop when they encounter an error (e.g., end of file). Make sure this is desired behavior.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Parallel Macros">
    Run macro on multiple lines:
    
    **Method 1: Visual block**
    ```vim
    CTRL-V    " Select lines in visual block
    :normal @a  " Execute macro on each line
    ```
    
    **Method 2: Global command**
    ```vim
    :g/pattern/normal @a  " Execute on matching lines
    ```
    
    **Method 3: Range**
    ```vim
    :1,10normal @a  " Execute on lines 1-10
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Macro Examples

  <Step title="Example 1: Add TODO Comments">
    Transform:
    ```python
    implement_feature()
    fix_bug()
    refactor_code()
    ```
    
    To:
    ```python
    # TODO: implement_feature()
    # TODO: fix_bug()
    # TODO: refactor_code()
    ```
    
    Macro:
    ```vim
    qa
    I# TODO: <ESC>
    j

    Transform:
    ```
    Name,Age,City
    Alice,30,NYC
    Bob,25,LA
    ```
    
    To:
    ```markdown
    | Name | Age | City |
    | Alice | 30 | NYC |
    | Bob | 25 | LA |
    ```
    
    Macro:
    ```vim
    qa
    :s/,/ | /g<CR>
    I| <ESC>
    A |<ESC>
    j
    q
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Example 3: Increment Numbers">
    Transform:
    ```
    Step 1: First
    Step 1: Second
    Step 1: Third
    ```
    
    To:
    ```
    Step 1: First
    Step 2: Second
    Step 3: Third
    ```
    
    Macro:
    ```vim
    qa
    /\d<CR>   " Find number
    <CTRL-A>  " Increment
    n         " Next match
    q
    ```
    
    Or use visual block with `g CTRL-A`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## External Commands

### Shell Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Execute Shell Commands">
    Run external commands:
    
    ```vim
    :!command          " Execute command, show output
    :r !command        " Read command output into buffer
    :w !command        " Write buffer to command's stdin
    :%!command         " Filter entire file through command
    ```
    
    **Examples:**
    ```vim
    :!ls -la           " List directory
    :r !date           " Insert current date
    :w !python         " Execute buffer as Python
    :%!sort            " Sort entire file
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Filter Text Through Commands">
    Use `!` operator with motions:
    
    ```vim
    !motion command    " Filter motion text through command
    
    !ip sort           " Sort current paragraph
    !G fmt             " Format from here to end
    !} column -t       " Format paragraph as table
    ```
    
    **With visual selection:**
    ```vim
    V      " Select lines
    !sort  " Sort selection
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Practical Examples">
    **Sort lines:**
    ```vim
    :%!sort            " Sort entire file
    :5,20!sort         " Sort lines 5-20
    !ip sort           " Sort current paragraph
    ```
    
    **Format JSON:**
    ```vim
    :%!jq .            " Pretty-print JSON
    :%!python -m json.tool  " Alternative
    ```
    
    **Format code:**
    ```vim
    :%!prettier --stdin-filepath %  " Format with Prettier
    :%!black -                      " Format Python with Black
    ```
    
    **Run through awk/sed:**
    ```vim
    :%!awk '{print $1}'             " Extract first field
    :%!sed 's/old/new/g'            " Search and replace
    ```
    
    **Calculate:**
    ```vim
    :r !bc <<<"2^10"                " Insert calculation result
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Read Command Output">
    Insert command output into buffer:
    
    ```vim
    :r !date                  " Insert date
    :r !ls                    " Insert file listing
    :r !git log --oneline -5  " Insert recent commits
    :0r !figlet "Title"       " Insert ASCII art at top
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    Use `:0r !command` to insert at file beginning, `:$r !command` at end.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Text Transformations

### Case Conversion

<Steps>
  <Step title="Case Operators">
    Change case with operators:
    
    | Command | Effect |
    |---------|--------|
    | `~` | Toggle case of character |
    | `g~` | Toggle case with motion |
    | `gU` | Uppercase with motion |
    | `gu` | Lowercase with motion |
    | `g~w` | Toggle word case |
    | `gUw` | Uppercase word |
    | `guw` | Lowercase word |
    | `g~~` | Toggle line case |
    | `gUU` | Uppercase line |
    | `guu` | Lowercase line |
    
    **With text objects:**
    ```vim
    gUiw    " UPPERCASE inner word
    guaw    " lowercase around word
    gU$     " UPPERCASE to end of line
    gu}     " lowercase to end of paragraph
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Visual Mode Case">
    Select then transform:
    
    ```vim
    viw     " Select word
    U       " Uppercase (or u for lowercase)
    
    V       " Select line
    U       " Uppercase line
    
    CTRL-V  " Block select
    U       " Uppercase block
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Substitution Case">
    Use case modifiers in replacement:
    
    ```vim
    :%s/\w\+/\U&/g         " UPPERCASE ALL WORDS
    :%s/\w\+/\L&/g         " lowercase all words
    :%s/\w\+/\u&/g         " Capitalize All Words
    :%s/\(\w\)\(\w*\)/\u\1\L\2/g  " Capitalize first letter only
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Sorting and Filtering

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sort Command">
    Built-in sorting:
    
    ```vim
    :sort            " Sort lines alphabetically
    :sort!           " Reverse sort
    :sort u          " Sort and remove duplicates
    :sort n          " Numeric sort
    :sort i          " Case-insensitive sort
    ```
    
    **With range:**
    ```vim
    :10,20sort       " Sort lines 10-20
    :g/^class/+1,/^}/-1sort  " Sort within each class
    ```
    
    **Sort by pattern:**
    ```vim
    :sort /\d\+/     " Sort by first number in line
    :sort /.*,/      " Sort by text after last comma
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Unique Lines">
    Remove duplicates:
    
    ```vim
    :sort u          " Sort and remove duplicates
    :g/^\(.*\)$\n\1$/d  " Remove adjacent duplicates
    ```
    
    **Keep only unique lines:**
    ```vim
    :%!uniq          " Remove adjacent duplicates (Unix)
    :%!sort | uniq   " Sort and remove all duplicates
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Filter Lines">
    Keep or remove lines:
    
    ```vim
    :g/pattern/d          " Delete matching lines
    :v/pattern/d          " Keep only matching lines
    :g/^$/d               " Remove blank lines
    :v/\S/d               " Remove lines without non-whitespace
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Indentation and Formatting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Indent Operations">
    Adjust indentation:
    
    ```vim
    >>      " Indent line
    <<      " Unindent line
    5>>     " Indent 5 lines
    >ip     " Indent paragraph
    >}      " Indent to end of paragraph
    =%      " Auto-indent to matching bracket
    =G      " Auto-indent to end of file
    gg=G    " Auto-indent entire file
    ```
    
    **Visual mode:**
    ```vim
    V       " Select lines
    >       " Indent
    >       " Indent again (stays selected)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Format Text">
    Reformat paragraphs:
    
    ```vim
    gq      " Format with motion
    gqip    " Format paragraph
    gqap    " Format paragraph (around)
    gq}     " Format to paragraph end
    gwip    " Format keeping cursor position
    ```
    
    **Set text width:**
    ```vim
    :set textwidth=80
    gqG     " Format to end with 80 char width
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Join Lines">
    Combine lines:
    
    ```vim
    J       " Join with next line (add space)
    gJ      " Join without space
    3J      " Join 3 lines
    :g/pattern/j  " Join all matching lines
    ```
    
    **Example: Join continued lines**
    ```vim
    :g/\\$/normal J  " Join lines ending with backslash
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-File Operations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Argument List">
    Operate on multiple files:
    
    ```vim
    :args *.py           " Load all Python files
    :args **/*.js        " Load all JS files recursively
    :argdo %s/old/new/ge | update  " Replace in all files
    ```
    
    **Navigate args:**
    ```vim
    :next       " Next file
    :prev       " Previous file
    :first      " First file
    :last       " Last file
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Buffer List">
    Operate on open buffers:
    
    ```vim
    :bufdo %s/old/new/ge | update  " Replace in all buffers
    :bufdo normal @a               " Run macro in all buffers
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Quickfix List">
    Use with search results:
    
    ```vim
    :vimgrep /pattern/ **/*.py  " Search all Python files
    :cdo s/old/new/g | update   " Replace in all matches
    :cfdo %s/old/new/ge | update  " Replace in each file
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Expression Register

<Steps>
  <Step title="Calculate in Buffer">
    Insert calculations:
    
    In Insert mode:
    ```vim
    <CTRL-R>=2+2<CR>           " Inserts 4
    <CTRL-R>=60*60*24<CR>      " Inserts 86400
    <CTRL-R>=system('date')<CR> " Inserts date
    ```
    
    In Normal mode:
    ```vim
    :put =range(1,10)          " Insert numbers 1-10
    :put =map(range(1,5), 'v:val*2')  " Insert 2,4,6,8,10
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Increment Numbers">
    Modify numbers:
    
    ```vim
    CTRL-A    " Increment number under cursor
    CTRL-X    " Decrement number under cursor
    5 CTRL-A  " Add 5 to number
    ```
    
    **Visual block increment:**
    ```vim
    CTRL-V      " Select column of numbers
    g CTRL-A    " Increment sequentially (1,2,3...)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
