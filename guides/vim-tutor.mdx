## What is Vimtutor?

Vimtutor is Vim's interactive, hands-on tutorial that teaches you the fundamentals of Vim editing. It takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and provides a practical way to learn by doing, not just reading.

<Note>
Vimtutor creates a temporary copy of the tutorial file, so you can safely experiment without worrying about breaking anything.
</Note>

## Starting Vimtutor

Launch vimtutor from your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Unix/Linux/macOS
vimtutor
```

```bash Windows
vim tutor1
```
</CodeGroup>

For Chapter 2 (advanced topics):

```bash
vim tutor2
```

## Chapter 1: Core Fundamentals

### Lesson 1.1: Basic Navigation and Editing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Moving the Cursor">
    Use `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` keys for navigation:
    
    ```
         k (up)
    h (left)  l (right)
        j (down)
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    The `h` key is at the left and moves left. The `l` key is at the right and moves right. The `j` key looks like a down arrow.
    </Tip>
    
    **Practice Exercise:**
    - Move the cursor around until comfortable
    - Hold `j` to move down repeatedly
    - Try arrow keys, but hjkl is faster once learned
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Exiting Vim">
    Two ways to exit:
    
    - `:q!` - Quit without saving (discard changes)
    - `:wq` - Write and quit (save changes)
    
    <Warning>
    Always press `<ESC>` first to ensure you're in Normal mode before typing commands.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deleting Characters">
    Press `x` to delete the character under the cursor.
    
    **Practice:**
    ```
    The ccow jumpedd ovverr thhe mooon.
    ```
    Fix this sentence by positioning the cursor on extra characters and pressing `x`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Inserting Text">
    - `i` - Insert before the cursor
    - `a` - Append after the cursor
    - `A` - Append at the end of the line
    
    After typing, press `<ESC>` to return to Normal mode.
    
    **Practice:**
    ```
    There is text misng this .
    ```
    Use `i` to insert "some" and "from" to complete the sentence.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Lesson 1.2: Deletion Commands

<Steps>
  <Step title="Delete Word">
    Type `dw` to delete from cursor to start of next word.
    
    **Practice:**
    ```
    There are a some words fun that don't belong paper in this sentence.
    ```
    Remove the extra words using `dw`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delete to End of Line">
    Type `d$` to delete from cursor to end of line.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Somebody typed the end of this line twice. end of this line twice.
    ```
    Position cursor after the first period and type `d$`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Understanding Operators and Motions">
    Vim commands follow the pattern: `operator [number] motion`
    
    - **Operator**: What to do (`d` for delete)
    - **Number**: How many times (optional)
    - **Motion**: Where to operate
    
    Common motions:
    - `w` - Until start of next word
    - `e` - To end of current word
    - `$` - To end of line
    - `0` - To start of line
    
    **Examples:**
    - `2w` - Move forward 2 words
    - `3e` - Move to end of 3rd word ahead
    - `d2w` - Delete 2 words
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delete Whole Line">
    Type `dd` to delete entire line.
    
    **With count:**
    - `2dd` - Delete 2 lines
    - `3dd` - Delete 3 lines
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Undo Commands">
    - `u` - Undo last change
    - `U` - Undo all changes on current line
    - `CTRL-R` - Redo (undo the undos)
    
    **Practice:**
    ```
    Fiix the errors oon thhis line and reeplace them witth undo.
    ```
    Fix with `x`, then experiment with `u` and `CTRL-R`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Put Command">
    Type `p` to paste previously deleted text after the cursor.

    b) Violets are blue,
    c) Intelligence is learned,

    ```
    
    Use `dd` to delete line, move cursor, then `p` to paste.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Replace Character">
    Type `r` followed by the replacement character.
    
    **Practice:**

    - `ce` - Change to end of word
    - `c$` - Change to end of line
    - `cc` - Change entire line
    - `cw` - Change word
