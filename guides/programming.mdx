title: Using Vim for Programming
description: Complete workflows and features for software development in Vim
---

Vim was created by a programmer, for programmers. This guide covers the complete workflow for using Vim as a powerful development environment.

## Quick Start for Developers

Set up Vim for programming in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
" Enable filetype detection and plugins
filetype plugin indent on

" Syntax highlighting
syntax on

" Programming-specific settings
set number          " Show line numbers
set autoindent      " Auto-indent new lines
set smartindent     " Smart auto-indenting for C-like code
set expandtab       " Use spaces instead of tabs
set shiftwidth=4    " Indentation width
set tabstop=4       " Tab display width

" Show matching brackets
set showmatch

" Enable code folding
set foldmethod=indent
set foldlevelstart=99
```

## Navigation and Code Exploration

### Using Tags for Code Navigation

Generate a tags file for your project:

```bash
ctags -R .
```

Navigate through your code:

- `CTRL-]` - Jump to definition of identifier under cursor
- `CTRL-T` - Jump back to previous location
- `:tag functionName` - Jump to specific tag
- `:tags` - Show tag stack
- `g]` - List all matching tags
- `:tselect` - Select from multiple tag matches

### Finding Identifiers

Search for where identifiers are defined or used:

- `gd` - Go to local declaration
- `gD` - Go to global declaration
- `[i` - Show first occurrence in current/included files
- `[I` - List all occurrences in current/included files
- `[CTRL-I` - Jump to match for `[i`
- `[d` - Show first macro definition
- `[D` - List all macro definitions

### Code Structure Navigation

Move through code blocks efficiently:

- `%` - Jump between matching parentheses, brackets, or braces
- `[(` - Go to previous unmatched `(`
- `])` - Go to next unmatched `)`
- `[{` - Go to previous unmatched `{`
- `]}` - Go to next unmatched `}`
- `[#` - Go to previous unmatched `#if` or `#ifdef`
- `]#` - Go to next unmatched `#else` or `#endif`
- `[/` - Go to previous start of comment
- `]/` - Go to next end of comment

## Compiling and Error Navigation

### The Quickfix Workflow

Compile your code and navigate errors without leaving Vim:

```vim
" Compile the project
:make

" Navigate through errors
:cnext          " Next error
:cprevious      " Previous error
:cfirst         " First error
:clast          " Last error
:cc             " Show current error
:clist          " List all errors
:copen          " Open quickfix window
:cclose         " Close quickfix window
```

### Custom Make Programs

Configure Vim for different build systems:

```vim
" For Python
set makeprg=python3\ %

" For Node.js
set makeprg=node\ %

" For Go
set makeprg=go\ build

" For Rust
set makeprg=cargo\ build

" For custom build script
set makeprg=./build.sh
```

## Code Editing Features

### Automatic Indentation

Vim provides powerful auto-indentation:

```vim
" Enable C-style indenting
set cindent

" Customize C indent options
set cinoptions=>4,n-2,{2,^-2,:2,=2,g0,h2,p5,t0,+2,(0,u0,w1,m1

" Re-indent code
=               " Re-indent current line
==              " Re-indent current line (same as above)
=G              " Re-indent from cursor to end of file
gg=G            " Re-indent entire file
={motion}       " Re-indent text covered by motion
```

### Comment Formatting

Format comments while staying in insert mode:

```vim
" In .vimrc - set comment formatting options
set formatoptions+=r    " Auto-insert comment leader on Enter
set formatoptions+=o    " Auto-insert comment leader with o/O
set formatoptions+=q    " Allow formatting comments with gq
set formatoptions+=j    " Remove comment leader when joining lines
```

Format comments:

- `gq{motion}` - Format comments
- `gqap` - Format comment paragraph
- `gqq` - Format current line

### Code Completion

Use Vim's built-in completion:

- `CTRL-N` - Next completion match (keyword)
- `CTRL-P` - Previous completion match (keyword)
- `CTRL-X CTRL-N` - Complete from current file
- `CTRL-X CTRL-I` - Complete from current and included files
- `CTRL-X CTRL-]` - Complete from tags
- `CTRL-X CTRL-F` - Complete filename
- `CTRL-X CTRL-L` - Complete whole line
- `CTRL-X CTRL-O` - Omni completion (language-aware)

## Working with Multiple Files

### Buffer Management

Efficiently work with multiple source files:

```vim
" Open files
:e src/main.c
:e src/utils.c

" Navigate buffers
:bnext          " Next buffer
:bprevious      " Previous buffer
:buffer 3       " Switch to buffer 3
:buffers        " List all buffers
CTRL-^          " Toggle between current and alternate buffer
```

### Split Windows

View multiple files simultaneously:

```vim
" Split windows
:split file.c   " Horizontal split
:vsplit file.h  " Vertical split

" Navigate splits
CTRL-W h        " Move to left window
CTRL-W j        " Move to bottom window
CTRL-W k        " Move to top window
CTRL-W l        " Move to right window
CTRL-W w        " Cycle through windows

" Resize splits
CTRL-W =        " Make all windows equal size
CTRL-W _        " Maximize height
CTRL-W |        " Maximize width
```

### Argument List

Work with a set of files:

```vim
" Set argument list
:args src/*.c
:args **/*.js   " Recursive

" Navigate arguments
:next           " Next file
:previous       " Previous file
:first          " First file
:last           " Last file
```

## Advanced Programming Features

### The Preview Window

View function declarations without leaving your location:

```vim
" Open preview window
:ptag functionName      " Preview tag
CTRL-W }                " Preview tag under cursor

" Navigate in preview
:pnext                  " Next match in preview
:pprevious              " Previous match in preview

" Close preview
:pclose                 " Close preview window
CTRL-W z                " Close preview window
```

### Include File Searches

Search through included files:

```vim
" Check include paths
:checkpath

" Search in includes
:isearch pattern        " Search in current and included files
:ijump pattern          " Jump to pattern in included files
:ilist pattern          " List all occurrences
```

### Code Folding

Hide and show code sections:

```vim
" Fold commands
zf{motion}      " Create fold
zc              " Close fold
zo              " Open fold
za              " Toggle fold
zC              " Close all folds recursively
zO              " Open all folds recursively
zM              " Close all folds
zR              " Open all folds
zd              " Delete fold
```

### Debugging Integration

While Vim has built-in debugging features, you can integrate with external debuggers:

```vim
" Set up makeprg for testing
set makeprg=pytest\ %

" Run tests and navigate failures
:make
:copen
```

## Language-Specific Features

### C/C++ Development

```vim
" In .vimrc
augroup c_programming
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType c,cpp setlocal cindent
    autocmd FileType c,cpp setlocal cinoptions=>4,n-2,{2
    autocmd FileType c,cpp setlocal makeprg=gcc\ -Wall\ -g\ %
augroup END
```

### Python Development

```vim
" In .vimrc
augroup python_programming
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType python setlocal expandtab
    autocmd FileType python setlocal shiftwidth=4
    autocmd FileType python setlocal softtabstop=4
    autocmd FileType python setlocal makeprg=python3\ %
    autocmd FileType python setlocal omnifunc=pythoncomplete#Complete
augroup END
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Development

```vim
" In .vimrc
augroup javascript_programming
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType javascript,typescript setlocal shiftwidth=2
    autocmd FileType javascript,typescript setlocal softtabstop=2
    autocmd FileType javascript,typescript setlocal makeprg=node\ %
augroup END
```

## Practical Workflows

### Refactoring: Rename Across Files

Rename a function or variable across multiple files:

```vim
" Open all files that might contain the symbol
:args src/**/*.c

" Perform substitution across all files
:argdo %s/oldFunction/newFunction/ge | update
```

### Finding and Fixing Bugs

1. Use `:grep` to find relevant code:
   ```vim
   :grep -r "buggy_function" src/
   ```

2. Navigate results with quickfix:
   ```vim
   :copen
   :cnext
   ```

3. Make fixes and compile:
   ```vim
   :make
   ```

### Code Review Workflow

Review changes using diff mode:

```vim
" Open files in diff mode
:vert diffsplit original.c

" Navigate differences
]c              " Next difference
[c              " Previous difference

" Merge changes
do              " Obtain (get) difference from other file
dp              " Put difference to other file
```

## Useful Mappings for Programming

Add these to your `.vimrc` for faster programming:

```vim
" Quick compilation
nnoremap <F5> :make<CR>
nnoremap <F6> :make clean<CR>

" Toggle between source and header
nnoremap <F4> :e %:p:s,.h$,.X123X,:s,.c$,.h,:s,.X123X$,.c,<CR>

" Quick tag navigation
nnoremap <Leader>t :tag <C-R><C-W><CR>
nnoremap <Leader>] <C-]>
nnoremap <Leader>[ <C-T>

" Format code
nnoremap <Leader>f gg=G``

" Quick comment toggle (requires commentary plugin or custom function)
nnoremap <Leader>c gcc
vnoremap <Leader>c gc
```

## Tips for Productivity

1. **Generate tags regularly**: Keep your tags file up to date with a Git hook or build script
2. **Use sessions**: Save your workspace with `:mksession` and restore with `vim -S`
3. **Learn text objects**: Master `ci{`, `da(`, `vit` for efficient code editing
4. **Configure per-project**: Use `.vimrc` local or project-specific settings
5. **Leverage quickfix**: Most programming tools can output to quickfix format

<Note>
For even more power, consider plugin managers like vim-plug or Vundle to install language servers, linters, and modern IDE-like features through plugins like coc.nvim or ALE.
