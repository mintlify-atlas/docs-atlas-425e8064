## Overview

Vim runs natively on Unix and Linux systems with full feature support. This guide covers installation methods, building from source, and platform-specific considerations.

## Installation Methods

### Using Package Managers

Most Linux distributions include Vim in their package repositories:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vim
```

```bash Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install vim
```

```bash Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S vim
```

```bash openSUSE
sudo zypper install vim
```

</CodeGroup>

### Building from Source

For the latest features or custom configurations, you can build Vim from source:

```bash Terminal
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
cd vim/src

# Build and install
make
make test
sudo make install
```

See the `INSTALL` file in the `src` directory for detailed build instructions and configuration options.

## Configuration

### Runtime Files

Vim looks for runtime files in standard Unix locations:

- System-wide configuration: `/usr/share/vim/`
- User configuration: `~/.vimrc`
- User runtime files: `~/.vim/`

Example directory structure:

```
~/.vim/
├── autoload/      # Autoloaded scripts
├── colors/        # Color schemes
├── ftplugin/      # Filetype plugins
├── plugin/        # Plugins
└── syntax/        # Syntax files
```

### Environment Variables

<ParamField path="$VIM" type="string">
  Location of Vim system files. Typically `/usr/share/vim`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="$VIMRUNTIME" type="string">
  Location of runtime files. Usually `$VIM/vim92` for version 9.2.
</ParamField>

## Platform-Specific Features

### Terminal Support

Vim on Unix/Linux has excellent terminal support:

- Full 256-color and true color support
- Mouse support in xterm-compatible terminals
- Integration with terminal clipboard via `+clipboard` feature

### X11 Integration

When compiled with X11 support:

- Access to X11 clipboard (`+` and `*` registers)
- X11 window title updates
- Mouse support in terminal

### Build Options

Common configure options for Unix builds:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Minimal Build
./configure --with-features=small
make
```

```bash Huge Build
./configure --with-features=huge \
  --enable-multibyte \
  --enable-python3interp \
  --enable-rubyinterp \
  --enable-perlinterp
make
```

```bash GUI Build
./configure --with-features=huge \
  --enable-gui=gtk3 \
  --enable-gnome-check
make
```

</CodeGroup>

## File System Considerations

### Path Separators

Unix/Linux uses forward slashes (`/`) for path separators:

```vim
:edit /home/user/file.txt
:set runtimepath+=~/.vim/custom
```

### Permissions

Vim respects Unix file permissions:

- Files are created with default umask
- Backup files preserve original permissions
- Can use `:write !sudo tee %` for privileged saves

### Symbolic Links

Vim follows symbolic links when editing files. Use `:set nofsync` if working with links on NFS.

## Common Issues

### Missing Features

Check which features are compiled in:

```vim
:version
```

Look for `+feature` (enabled) or `-feature` (disabled). Common features:

- `+clipboard` - System clipboard access
- `+python3` - Python 3 support
- `+X11` - X11 integration

### Terminal Colors

If colors don't display correctly:

```vim
" Force 256 colors
set t_Co=256

" Enable true color (24-bit)
if has('termguicolors')
  set termguicolors
endif
```

### Locale Issues

Ensure your locale supports UTF-8:

```bash
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

## Performance Tips

### Large Files

For better performance with large files:

```vim
" Disable syntax highlighting for large files
autocmd BufReadPre * if getfsize(expand("%")) > 10000000 | syntax off | endif

" Increase memory limits
set maxmempattern=2000000
```

### Network File Systems

When editing files on NFS or similar:

```vim
set nofsync          " Don't force sync to disk
set nobackup         " Don't create backup files
set nowritebackup    " Don't create backup before overwriting
```

## Integration

### Shell Integration

Vim integrates seamlessly with Unix shells:

```vim
" Run shell command and insert output
:read !ls -la

" Filter lines through shell command
:1,5!sort

" Set shell explicitly
set shell=/bin/bash
```

### Man Page Viewer

Use Vim as a man page viewer:

```bash
export MANPAGER="vim -M +MANPAGER -"
```

### Diff Tool

Use vimdiff for comparing files:

```bash
vimdiff file1.txt file2.txt
# or
vim -d file1.txt file2.txt
```
