## Why Movement Matters

Efficient movement is the foundation of Vim mastery. While other editors rely on mouse clicks and arrow keys, Vim provides a rich vocabulary of motion commands that keep your hands on the home row and your editing at peak speed.

<Tip>
The faster you can move to where you want to edit, the faster you can work. Master these motions and watch your productivity soar.
</Tip>

## Character and Line Movement

### Basic Motions

<Steps>
  <Step title="The hjkl Keys">
    The fundamental motion keys:
    
    ```
         k (up)
    h (left)  l (right)
        j (down)
    ```
    
    **Why hjkl?**
    - Keeps hands on home row
    - No need to reach for arrow keys
    - Works in all Vim modes
    
    <Note>
    On old keyboards, the `j` key had a physical arrow pointing down. This design choice persists today.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Line Navigation">
    Move efficiently within a line:
    
    | Command | Action | Example |
    |---------|--------|----------|
    | `0` | Start of line | Always goes to column 0 |
    | `^` | First non-blank character | Skips leading whitespace |
    | `$` | End of line | Last character |
    | `g_` | Last non-blank character | Ignores trailing spaces |
    | `|` | Column (with count) | `10|` goes to column 10 |
    
    **Practice Pattern:**
    ```vim
    0  " Jump to start
    $  " Jump to end
    ^  " Jump to first non-blank
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Word Movement

### Understanding Words vs WORDS

Vim has two concepts of "word":

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="word (lowercase)">
    A sequence of letters, digits, and underscores, OR a sequence of other non-blank characters.
    
    **Example breakdown:**
    ```
    foo-bar.baz_qux
    ^^^ ^^^ ^^^ ^^^
    word word word word
    ```
    
    **Commands:**
    - `w` - Forward to start of next word
    - `b` - Backward to start of word
    - `e` - Forward to end of word
    - `ge` - Backward to end of word
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="WORD (uppercase)">
    A sequence of non-blank characters separated by whitespace.
    
    **Example breakdown:**
    ```
    foo-bar.baz_qux
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    one WORD
    ```
    
    **Commands:**
    - `W` - Forward to start of next WORD
    - `B` - Backward to start of WORD
    - `E` - Forward to end of WORD
    - `gE` - Backward to end of WORD
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Word Motion Practice

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basic Word Navigation">
    Try these on the practice line:
    
    ```
    The quick-brown fox jumps over the lazy_dog
    ```
    
    - Place cursor at start
    - Press `w` repeatedly - notice how it stops at each "word"
    - Go back to start
    - Press `W` repeatedly - notice fewer stops
    - Try `b` and `B` to move backward
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Combining with Operators">
    Word motions combine with operators:
    
    | Command | Effect |
    |---------|--------|
    | `dw` | Delete word forward |
    | `db` | Delete word backward |
    | `cw` | Change word forward |
    | `dW` | Delete WORD forward |
    | `yiw` | Yank inner word (anywhere on word) |
    | `yaw` | Yank around word (includes space) |
    
    **Real-world example:**
    ```python
    def calculateUserScore(self, user_id):
    ```
    
    - Cursor on "calculate", type `ciw` to change just that word
    - Cursor on "User", type `daw` to delete "User" and space
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Count Prefixes">
    Add numbers to multiply motions:
    
    ```vim
    3w   " Move forward 3 words
    5b   " Move back 5 words
    2e   " Move to end of 2nd word ahead
    d3w  " Delete 3 words
    c5W  " Change 5 WORDS
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    Use counts instead of repeating motions. `5w` is faster than pressing `w` five times.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Line Movement

### Vertical Navigation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Relative Line Jumps">
    Move by screen lines or file lines:
    
    | Command | Action | Use Case |
    |---------|--------|----------|
    | `j` / `k` | Down/up one line | Basic movement |
    | `gj` / `gk` | Down/up display line | Long wrapped lines |
    | `5j` | Down 5 lines | Quick small jumps |
    | `10k` | Up 10 lines | Return to context |
    | `CTRL-D` | Down half screen | Fast scrolling |
    | `CTRL-U` | Up half screen | Fast scrolling |
    | `CTRL-F` | Forward one screen | Page down |
    | `CTRL-B` | Back one screen | Page up |
    
    <Note>
    With `relativenumber` option enabled, you can see the count needed: `:set relativenumber`
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Absolute Line Jumps">
    Jump to specific line numbers:
    
    ```vim
    G       " Go to last line
    gg      " Go to first line
    50G     " Go to line 50
    :50     " Also goes to line 50
    50gg    " Alternative syntax
    ```
    
    **See current position:**
    ```vim
    CTRL-G  " Show file info and line number
    ```
    
    **With line numbers visible:**
    ```vim
    :set number
    :set relativenumber
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Screen Position Jumps">
    Move cursor to different screen positions:
    
    | Command | Position |
    |---------|----------|
    | `H` | Top of screen (High) |
    | `M` | Middle of screen |
    | `L` | Bottom of screen (Low) |
    | `5H` | 5 lines below top |
    | `3L` | 3 lines above bottom |
    | `zt` | Current line to top |
    | `zz` | Current line to center |
    | `zb` | Current line to bottom |
    
    **Workflow example:**
    ```vim
    /function    " Find function
    zt           " Move to top of screen
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Search-Based Movement

### Character Search

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Character in Line">
    Super fast intra-line navigation:
    
    | Command | Action | Repeatable |
    |---------|--------|------------|
    | `fx` | Find next 'x' on line | `;` / `,` |
    | `Fx` | Find previous 'x' on line | `;` / `,` |
    | `tx` | Till before next 'x' | `;` / `,` |
    | `Tx` | Till after previous 'x' | `;` / `,` |
    | `;` | Repeat last f/F/t/T forward | - |
    | `,` | Repeat last f/F/t/T backward | - |
    
    **Practice line:**
    ```python
    result = calculate(x, y, z, threshold=0.95)
    ```
    
    - `f(` - Jump to opening parenthesis
    - `f,` - Jump to first comma
    - `;` - Jump to next comma
    - `;` - Jump to third comma
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Combined with Operators">
    Character search is powerful with operators:
    
    ```vim
    dfx  " Delete from cursor to and including next 'x'
    dtx  " Delete from cursor to (till) before next 'x'
    cfx  " Change from cursor to and including next 'x'
    ytx  " Yank from cursor till before next 'x'
    ```
    
    **Real-world examples:**
    
    On this line:
    ```javascript
    const user = { name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "NYC" };
    ```
    
    - Cursor on `c` in `const`, type `ct=` changes "const user " (till equals)
    - Cursor on `{`, type `f:` jumps to first colon
    - Type `dt,` deletes `"Alice"`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pro Tips">
    <Tip>
    **Tip 1:** `f` and `t` are different! Use `t` when you want to preserve the target character.
    </Tip>
    
    <Tip>
    **Tip 2:** After `fx`, use `;` to repeat. It's faster than typing `fx` again.
    </Tip>
    
    <Warning>
    Character search only works on the current line. Use `/` for multi-line search.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Pattern Search

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basic Search">
    Search across the entire file:
    
    | Command | Action |
    |---------|--------|
    | `/pattern` | Search forward |
    | `?pattern` | Search backward |
    | `n` | Next match (same direction) |
    | `N` | Next match (opposite direction) |
    | `*` | Search forward for word under cursor |
    | `#` | Search backward for word under cursor |
    | `g*` | Search forward for partial word |
    | `g#` | Search backward for partial word |
    
    **Example workflow:**
    ```vim
    /function     " Search for 'function'
    n             " Next match
    n             " Next match
    N             " Previous match
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Search Options">
    Customize search behavior:
    
    ```vim
    :set ignorecase    " Case-insensitive search
    :set smartcase     " Case-sensitive if uppercase used
    :set incsearch     " Show matches as you type
    :set hlsearch      " Highlight all matches
    :nohlsearch        " Clear highlight (or :noh)
    ```
    
    **One-time case override:**
    ```vim
    /pattern\c         " Force case-insensitive
    /pattern\C         " Force case-sensitive
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Advanced Search Patterns">
    Use regex for powerful searches:
    
    ```vim
    /^function         " Lines starting with 'function'
    /function$         " Lines ending with 'function'
    /^$                " Empty lines
    /\<word\>          " Exact word (word boundaries)
    /foo\|bar          " 'foo' OR 'bar'
    /[0-9]\+           " One or more digits
    ```
    
    <Note>
    Vim uses its own regex flavor. See `:help pattern` for details.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Jump Navigation

### The Jump List

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understanding Jumps">
    Vim maintains a jump list of your cursor positions:
    
    | Command | Action |
    |---------|--------|
    | `CTRL-O` | Jump back (older position) |
    | `CTRL-I` | Jump forward (newer position) |
    | `:jumps` | View jump list |
    
    **What creates a jump?**
    - Search commands (`/`, `?`, `*`, `#`)
    - Line jumps (`G`, `gg`, `[line]G`)
    - File changes (`:e`, `:tag`)
    - Marks (`'a`, `` `a ``)
    
    **What doesn't?**
    - Basic movement (`hjkl`, `w`, `b`, `e`)
    - Small jumps (moving a few lines)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Jump Workflow">
    Common navigation pattern:
    
    ```vim
    /errorHandler    " Search for function
    n                " Find next occurrence
    CTRL-O           " Jump back to previous position
    *                " Search word under cursor
    CTRL-O           " Return to where you started
    CTRL-I           " Go forward again
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    Think of `CTRL-O` and `CTRL-I` like browser back/forward buttons.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Marks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setting Marks">
    Create bookmarks in your file:
    
    | Command | Action |
    |---------|--------|
    | `ma` | Set mark 'a' at cursor position |
    | `` `a `` | Jump to exact position of mark 'a' |
    | `'a` | Jump to first non-blank of mark 'a' line |
    | `:marks` | View all marks |
    | `` ` `` | Jump to position before last jump |
    | `''` | Jump to line before last jump |
    
    **Mark types:**
    - `a-z` - Local marks (per buffer)
    - `A-Z` - Global marks (across files)
    - `0-9` - Last exit positions (automatic)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Practical Marking">
    Real-world usage:
    
    ```vim
    "Edit function header
    ma              " Mark as 'a'
    /function_body  " Search for implementation
    "Edit body...
    'a              " Return to marked header
    ```
    
    **Multi-file workflow:**
    ```vim
    " In file1.py
    mA              " Set global mark A
    :e file2.py     " Edit another file
    " ...work in file2...
    'A              " Jump back to file1.py at mark A
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Special Automatic Marks">
    Vim sets these marks automatically:
    
    | Mark | Meaning |
    |------|----------|
    | `` ` `` | Position before last jump |
    | `[` | Start of last change/yank |
    | `]` | End of last change/yank |
    | `<` | Start of last visual selection |
    | `>` | End of last visual selection |
    | `.` | Last change position |
    | `^` | Last insert position |
    
    **Quick actions:**
    ```vim
    `.    " Jump to last change
    `^    " Jump to last insert
    `[    " Jump to start of last paste
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Matching and Bracket Navigation

### Bracket Matching

<Steps>
  <Step title="The % Motion">
    Jump between matching pairs:
    
    | Matches | Examples |
    |---------|----------|
    | `( )` | Parentheses |
    | `[ ]` | Square brackets |
    | `{ }` | Curly braces |
    | `/* */` | C comments |
    | `#if #endif` | Preprocessor (with plugin) |
    
    **Usage:**
    ```vim
    %    " Jump to matching bracket
    d%   " Delete to matching bracket
    y%   " Yank to matching bracket
    v%   " Select to matching bracket
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    Essential for debugging unmatched parentheses in code!
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Section Movement">
    Jump between sections (functions, classes):
    
    | Command | Action |
    |---------|--------|
    | `]]` | Next section forward (or function) |
    | `[[` | Previous section backward |
    | `][` | Next section end |
    | `[]` | Previous section end |
    
    <Note>
    What constitutes a "section" depends on filetype. For C, it's typically function boundaries.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Movement Optimization Strategies

### The Vim Way

<Steps>
  <Step title="Think in Text Objects, Not Characters">
    ❌ **Slow way:**
    ```vim
    llllllllllx    " Move right 10 times, delete
    ```
    
    ✅ **Fast way:**
    ```vim
    10l x          " Or better: dw, de, dt)
    ```
    
    ✅ **Best way:**
    ```vim
    dw             " Delete word (from anywhere on it)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Combine Operators with Motions">
    The power formula: `operator + count + motion`
    
    **Examples:**
    ```vim
    d3w     " Delete 3 words
    c2j     " Change current and next 2 lines
    y$      " Yank to end of line
    >5j     " Indent 5 lines down
    gU3w    " Uppercase 3 words
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Relative Line Numbers">
    Enable for easier vertical movement:
    
    ```vim
    :set relativenumber
    :set number
    ```
    
    Now you can see the count directly:
    ```
     7  some line above
     6  another line
     5  target line
     4
     3
     2
     1
    42  current line (absolute)
     1  
     2
     3  line below
    ```
    
    Type `5k` to jump up to "target line".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Develop Muscle Memory">
    <Card title="Practice Routine" icon="dumbbell">
      1. **Daily drills**: Set a 5-minute timer and practice motions
      2. **Conscious practice**: Force yourself to use new motions
      3. **Ban the arrows**: Unmap arrow keys temporarily
      4. **Track patterns**: Notice which motions you need most
