# Installation

You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim. On macOS and Linux, a small version of Vim is pre-installed, but you'll want to install the full version for more features.

<Note>
  If you already have an executable version of Vim, you don't need to compile it yourself. Jump to [Verification](#verification) to confirm your installation.
</Note>

## Quick install

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ### Using Homebrew
    
    The recommended way to install Vim on macOS:
    
    ```bash
    # Install Homebrew if you haven't already
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    
    # Install Vim
    brew install vim
    ```
    
    ### Using MacVim
    
    For a native macOS GUI experience, use [MacVim](https://macvim.org):
    
    ```bash
    brew install --cask macvim
    ```
    
    MacVim includes both the GUI application and terminal Vim with full feature support.
  </Tab>

    ### From source
    
    See [Building from source](#building-from-source-unix) for detailed instructions.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ### Using the installer (Recommended)
    
    Download the latest installer from the [vim-win32-installer](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases) repository.
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Download the installer">
        Get the latest `gvim_X.X.XXXX.exe` file from the releases page.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Run the installer">
        Double-click the downloaded file and follow the prompts. The installer is mostly self-explanatory.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Choose installation directory">
        Use the same location as other versions if you're upgrading. For example: `C:\Program Files\vim` or `D:\vim`. A name ending in "vim" is preferred.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Complete installation">
        Click "Next" to start the installation. The installer will set up Vim and optionally add it to your PATH.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    <Warning>
      When an existing installation is detected, you'll be offered to remove it first. Complete the uninstall before continuing. Watch the taskbar for uninstall windows that may appear behind the installer.
    </Warning>
    
    ### Using zip archives
    
    If you prefer manual installation:
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to installation directory">
        ```cmd
        cd C:\
        ```
        
        Or if you already have a vim directory:
        ```cmd
        cd C:\vim
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Extract archives">
        ```cmd
        # This creates vim\vim92 directory
        unzip vim92w32.zip
        ```
        
        Extract both the runtime archive and at least one binary archive to the same location.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Run install program">
        ```cmd
        cd vim\vim92
        install.exe
        ```
        
        The installer will ask about your preferences:
        - Create `_vimrc` with your settings
        - Add "Edit with Vim" to Windows Explorer context menu
        - Create batch files for command line use
        - Add desktop and Start menu shortcuts
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Building from source (Unix)

Building Vim from source gives you full control over features and ensures you have the latest version.

### Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Ubuntu/Debian">
    ```bash
    # Basic build tools
    sudo apt install git make clang libtool-bin
    
    # For X11 clipboard support (recommended)
    sudo apt install libxt-dev
    
    # For GUI support (optional)
    sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
    
    # For Python 3 support (optional)
    sudo apt install libpython3-dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Fedora/RHEL">
    ```bash
    # Basic build tools
    sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
    sudo dnf install git gcc make ncurses-devel
    
    # For GUI support (optional)
    sudo dnf install gtk3-devel
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ```bash
    # Install Xcode Command Line Tools
    xcode-select --install
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Build steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
    cd vim/src
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build with default features">
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    
    This will automatically include GUI and X11 libraries if you have them. For a minimal build, see the Makefile for options to disable features.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run tests (optional)">
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
    
    This ensures your build has no problems before installation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install">
    ```bash
    sudo make install
    ```
    
    This installs Vim in `/usr/local` by default.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Build configuration

To customize your build, you can pass options to configure:

<CodeGroup>
```bash GUI options
# Enable specific GUI
./configure --enable-gui=gtk3    # GTK 3
./configure --enable-gui=motif   # Motif
./configure --enable-gui=auto    # Auto-detect (default)

# Disable GUI entirely
./configure --disable-gui
```

```bash Python support
# Enable Python 3 (uncomment CONF_OPT_PYTHON3 in Makefile)
./configure --enable-python3interp
make reconfig
```

```bash Custom paths
# Use custom prefix
./configure --prefix=/usr

# Custom runtime location
make VIMRUNTIMEDIR=/usr/share/vim

# Custom vimrc location
make VIMRCLOC=/etc
```

```bash Extra compiler flags
# Add custom CFLAGS or LIBS
env CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LIBS=-lm make
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  On Linux, you usually need GUI "-devel" packages. Having GTK libraries installed isn't enough - you also need the header files to compile Vim with GUI support.
</Tip>

## Building on Windows

For Windows builds, you can use several toolchains:

### Visual Studio (Recommended)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Visual Studio">
    Download "Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition" (free) or "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022". During installation, select "Desktop development with C++" workload.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open Developer Command Prompt">
    Launch "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022" from the Start menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to source">
    ```cmd
    cd path\to\vim\src
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build Vim">
    ```cmd
    # Console version
    nmake -f Make_mvc.mak
    
    # GUI version
    nmake -f Make_mvc.mak GUI=yes
    
    # With additional features
    nmake -f Make_mvc.mak GUI=yes OLE=yes PYTHON3=C:\Python311
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Vim versions built with VS2019 or VS2022 are systematically tested and work on Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11 and all respective server variants.
</Note>

### MSYS2 with MinGW

```bash
# Install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org
# Then in MSYS2 terminal:
pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

cd vim/src
make -f Make_ming.mak
```

## Verification

Verify your installation by checking the version:

```bash
vim --version
```

You should see output like:

```
VIM - Vi IMproved 9.2 (2026 Jan 14, compiled Jan 15 2026 12:00:00)
Included patches: 1-500
Compiled by user@hostname
...
```

<Tip>
  Look for the features you need in the output. Lines starting with `+` indicate enabled features, while `-` means disabled. Common features to check: `+python3`, `+clipboard`, `+terminal`.
</Tip>

## Post-installation

### Set as default editor

<CodeGroup>
```bash Bash
echo 'export VISUAL=vim' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export EDITOR=vim' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

```zsh Zsh
echo 'export VISUAL=vim' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export EDITOR=vim' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

```fish Fish
set -Ux VISUAL vim
set -Ux EDITOR vim
```
</CodeGroup>

### Configuration file

Vim looks for your configuration file in these locations:

- **Unix/Linux/macOS**: `~/.vimrc`
- **Windows**: `$VIM/_vimrc`
- **Haiku**: `~/config/settings/vim/vimrc`

Create a basic configuration:

```vim ~/.vimrc
" Get the defaults that most users want
source $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim

" Enable line numbers
set number

" Enable syntax highlighting
syntax on

" Set tabs to 4 spaces
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab

" Enable mouse support
set mouse=a

" Show matching brackets
set showmatch

" Incremental search
set incsearch

" Highlight search results
set hlsearch
```

<Note>
  You can find an example configuration at `$VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim`. Copy it to your vimrc location to get started with sensible defaults.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Vim can't find runtime files

If `:help` doesn't work or the GUI has no menubar, set the `$VIM` environment variable:

```bash
# Add to your shell rc file
export VIM=/usr/share/vim
```

On Windows:

```cmd
set VIM=C:\vim
```

### Missing features

If features are missing, rebuild Vim with the necessary libraries installed. Use `vim --version` to see which features are enabled.

### GUI not available

Ensure you have GUI libraries and development headers installed before compiling. On Linux, install `libgtk-3-dev` or similar packages for your distribution.
